0,"Zero-shot translation, translating between language pairs on which a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system has never been trained, is an emergent property when training the system in multilingual settings. However, naive training for zero-shot NMT easily fails, and is sensitive to hyper-parameter setting. The performance typically lags far behind the more conventional pivot-based approach which translates twice using a third language as a pivot. In this work, we address the degeneracy problem due to capturing spurious correlations by quantitatively analyzing the mutual information between language IDs of the source and decoded sentences. Inspired by this analysis, we propose to use two simple but effective approaches: (1) decoder pre-training; (2) back-translation. These methods show significant improvement (4 22 BLEU points) over the vanilla zero-shot translation on three challenging multilingual datasets, and achieve similar or better results than the pivot-based approach.",Improved Zero-shot Neural Machine Translation via Ignoring Spurious Correlations,Pre-training and Back-translation for Zero-Shot Neural Machine Translation in Multilingual Settings,Pre-training and Back-translation for Zero-Shot Neural Machine Translation,Pre-training and Back-translation for Zero-Shot Neural Machine Translation
1,"Biomedical named entities often play important roles in many biomedical text mining tools. However, due to the incompleteness of provided synonyms and numerous variations in their surface forms, normalization of biomedical entities is very challenging. In this paper, we focus on learning representations of biomedical entities solely based on the synonyms of entities. To learn from the incomplete synonyms, we use a model-based candidate selection and maximize the marginal likelihood of the synonyms present in top candidates. Our model-based candidates are iteratively updated to contain more difficult negative samples as our model evolves. In this way, we avoid the explicit pre-selection of negative samples from more than 400K candidates. On four biomedical entity normalization datasets having three different entity types (disease, chemical, adverse reaction), our model BioSyn consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art models almost reaching the upper bound on each dataset.",Biomedical Entity Representations with Synonym Marginalization,Learning Representations of Biomedical Named Entities from Incomplete Synonyms,Learning Biomedical Entity Representations from Incomplete Synonyms,Learning Biomedical Entity Synonyms
2,"By describing the features and abstractions of our world, language is a crucial tool for human learning and a promising source of supervision for machine learning models. We use language to improve few-shot visual classification in the underexplored scenario where natural language task descriptions are available during training, but unavailable for novel tasks at test time. Existing models for this setting sample new descriptions at test time and use those to classify images. Instead, we propose language-shaped learning (LSL), an end-to-end model that regularizes visual representations to predict language. LSL is conceptually simpler, more data efficient, and outperforms baselines in two challenging few-shot domains.",Shaping Visual Representations with Language for Few-Shot Classification,Language-Shaped Learning for Few-Shot Visual Classification,Language-Shaped Learning for Few-Shot Visual Classification,Language-Shaped Learning for Few-Shot Visual Classification
3,"The paper presents an approach to ellipsis resolution in a framework of scope underspecification (Underspecified Discourse Representation Theory). It is argued that the approach improves on previous proposals to integrate ellipsis resolution and scope underspecification (Crouch, 1995; Egg et al., 2001) in that application processes like anaphora resolution do not require full disambiguation but can work directly on the underspecified representation. Furthermore it is shown that the approach presented can cope with the examples discussed by Dalrymple et al. (1991) as well as a problem noted recently by Erk and Koller (2001).",Ellipsis Resolution with Underspecified Scope,A Framework for ellipsis resolution in scope underspecification,Ellipsis Resolution in a Scope Underspecified Representation,Ellipsis Resolution in a Scope Underspecified Representation
4,"A number of recent publications have made use of the incremental output of stochastic parsers to derive measures of high utility for psycholinguistic modeling, following the work of Hale (2001; 2003; 2006). In this paper, we present novel methods for calculating separate lexical and syntactic surprisal measures from a single incremental parser using a lexicalized PCFG. We also present an approximation to entropy measures that would otherwise be intractable to calculate for a grammar of that size. Empirical results demonstrate the utility of our methods in predicting human reading times.",Deriving lexical and syntactic expectation-based measures for psycholinguistic modeling via incremental top-down parsing,Calculating Separate Lexical and Syntactic Surprisal Measures from a Single Incremental Parser,Incremental Measures of High Utility for Psycholinguistic Modeling,Incremental Measures of High Utility for Psycholinguistic Modeling
5,"We present a family of priors over probabilistic grammar weights, called the shared logistic normal distribution. This family extends the partitioned logistic normal distribution, enabling factored covariance between the probabilities of different derivation events in the probabilistic grammar, providing a new way to encode prior knowledge about an unknown grammar. We describe a variational EM algorithm for learning a probabilistic grammar based on this family of priors. We then experiment with unsupervised dependency grammar induction and show significant improvements using our model for both monolingual learning and bilingual learning with a non-parallel, multilingual corpus.",Shared Logistic Normal Distributions for Soft Parameter Tying in Unsupervised Grammar Induction,A Shared Logistic Normal Distribution for Learning Probabilistic Grammars,A Shared Logistic Normal Distribution for Learning Probabilistic Grammars,A Shared Logistic Normal Distribution for Learning Probabilistic Grammars
6,"We analyze human's disagreements about the validity of natural language inferences. We show that, very often, disagreements are not dismissible as annotation ""noise"", but rather persist as we collect more ratings and as we vary the amount of context provided to raters. We further show that the type of uncertainty captured by current state-of-the-art models for natural language inference is not reflective of the type of uncertainty present in human disagreements. We discuss implications of our results in relation to the recognizing textual entailment (RTE)/natural language inference (NLI) task. We argue for a refined evaluation objective that requires models to explicitly capture the full distribution of plausible human judgments.",Inherent Disagreements in Human Textual Inferences,Exploring Human Disagreement about the Validity of Natural Language Inference Tasks,Human Disagreement about Natural Language Inference: A Case Study on RTE and LI,Human Disagreement about Natural Language Inference: A Case for Refined Evaluation
7,"This paper describes an algorithm for detecting empty nodes in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), finding their antecedents, and assigning them function tags, without access to lexical information such as valency. Unlike previous approaches to this task, the current method is not corpus-based, but rather makes use of the principles of early Government-Binding theory (Chomsky, 1981), the syntactic theory that underlies the annotation. Using the evaluation metric proposed by Johnson (2002), this approach outperforms previously published approaches on both detection of empty categories and antecedent identification, given either annotated input stripped of empty categories or the output of a parser. Some problems with this evaluation metric are noted and an alternative is proposed along with the results. The paper considers the reasons a principlebased approach to this problem should outperform corpus-based approaches, and speculates on the possibility of a hybrid approach.",Using Linguistic Principles to Recover Empty Categories,A Principle-Based Approach to Empty Categories in the Penn Treebank,A Principle-Based Approach to Empty Categories in the Penn Treebank,Empty Node Detection with a General Syntactic Theory
8,"When a word sense disambiguation (WSD) system is trained on one domain but applied to a different domain, a drop in accuracy is frequently observed. This highlights the importance of domain adaptation for word sense disambiguation. In this paper, we first show that an active learning approach can be successfully used to perform domain adaptation of WSD systems. Then, by using the predominant sense predicted by expectation-maximization (EM) and adopting a count-merging technique, we improve the effectiveness of the original adaptation process achieved by the basic active learning approach.",Domain Adaptation with Active Learning for Word Sense Disambiguation,Domain Adaptation with Active Learning for Word Sense Disambiguation,Domain Adaptation for Word Sense Disambiguation,Domain Adaptation for Word Sense Disambiguation
9,"Emotions are an important element of human nature, often affecting the overall wellbeing of a person. Therefore, it is no surprise that the health domain is a valuable area of interest for emotion detection, as it can provide medical staff or caregivers with essential information about patients. However, progress on this task has been hampered by the absence of large labeled datasets. To this end, we introduce CancerEmo, an emotion dataset created from an online health community and annotated with eight fine-grained emotions. We perform a comprehensive analysis of these emotions and develop deep learning models on the newly created dataset. Our best BERT model achieves an average F1 of 71%, which we improve further using domain-specific pre-training.",CancerEmo: A Dataset for Fine-Grained Emotion Detection,CancerEmo: A Large-Scale Dataset for Emotion Detection in the Health Domain,CancerEmo: A Large-Scale Dataset for Emotion Detection in the Health Domain,CancerEmo: A Large-Scale Dataset for Emotion Detection in the Health Domain

While operating at the character level, the model makes use of wordlevel and contextual information. In contrast to previous work, the proposed approach learns to correct a variety of error types without guidance of manuallyselected constraints or language-specific features.

12,"Much of human dialogue occurs in semi-cooperative settings, where agents with different goals attempt to agree on common decisions. Negotiations require complex communication and reasoning skills, but success is easy to measure, making this an interesting task for AI. We gather a large dataset of human-human negotiations on a multi-issue bargaining task, where agents who cannot observe each other's reward functions must reach an agreement (or a deal) via natural language dialogue. For the first time, we show it is possible to train end-to-end models for negotiation, which must learn both linguistic and reasoning skills with no annotated dialogue states. We also introduce dialogue rollouts, in which the model plans ahead by simulating possible complete continuations of the conversation, and find that this technique dramatically improves performance. Our code and dataset are publicly available.",Deal or No Deal? End-to-End Learning of Negotiation Dialogues,Deal or No Deal?

In this paper, we use a geometric perspective to prove that minimal peer prediction mechanisms are equivalent to power diagrams, a type of weighted Voronoi diagram. Using this characterization and results from computational geometry, we show that many of the mechanisms in the literature are unique up to affine transformations, and introduce a general method to construct new truthful mechanisms.",A Geometric Method to Construct Minimal Peer Prediction Mechanisms,A Geometric Method to Construct Minimal Peer Prediction Mechanisms,Minimal Peer Prediction Mechanisms are Power Diagrams,Minimal Peer Prediction Mechanisms are Power Diagrams
14,We present a general Bayesian approach to probabilistic matrix factorization subject to linear constraints. The approach is based on a Gaussian observation model and Gaussian priors with bilinear equality and inequality constraints. We present an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo inference procedure based on Gibbs sampling. Special cases of the proposed model are Bayesian formulations of nonnegative matrix factorization and factor analysis. The method is evaluated on a blind source separation problem. We demonstrate that our algorithm can be used to extract meaningful and interpretable features that are remarkably different from features extracted using existing related matrix factorization techniques.,Linearly constrained Bayesian matrix factorization for blind source separation,Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization with Linear Constraints,Bayesian Matrix Factorization with Gaussian Priors,Bayesian Matrix Factorization
15,"Research on temporal knowledge bases, which associate a relational fact (s,r,o) with a validity time period (or time instant), is in its early days. Our work considers predicting missing entities (link prediction) and missing time intervals (time prediction) as joint Temporal Knowledge Base Completion (TKBC) tasks, and presents TIMEPLEX, a novel TKBC method, in which entities, relations and, time are all embedded in a uniform, compatible space. TIMEPLEX exploits the recurrent nature of some facts/events and temporal interactions between pairs of relations, yielding state-of-the-art results on both prediction tasks. We also find that existing TKBC models heavily overestimate link prediction performance due to imperfect evaluation mechanisms. In response, we propose improved TKBC evaluation protocols for both link and time prediction tasks, dealing with subtle issues that arise from the partial overlap of time intervals in gold instances and system predictions.",Temporal Knowledge Base Completion: New Algorithms and Evaluation Protocols,TIMEPLEX: Joint Entity and Time Prediction for Temporal Knowledge Base Completion,TIMEPLEX: Joint Entity and Time Prediction for Temporal Knowledge Base Completion,TIMEPLEX: Joint Entity and Time Prediction in Temporal Knowledge Bases

17,"This paper proposes a new computational treatment of lexical rules as used in the HPSG framework. A compiler is described which translates a set of lexical rules and their interaction into a definite clause encoding, which is called by the base lexical entries in the lexicon. This way, the disjunctive possibilities arising from lexical rule application are encoded as systematic covariation in the specification of lexical entries. The compiler ensures the automatic transfer of properties not changed by a lexical rule. Program transformation techniques are used to advance the encoding. The final output of the compiler constitutes an efficient computational counterpart of the linguistic generalizations captured by lexical rules and allows on-the-fly application of lexical rules.",A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules in HPSG as Covariation in Lexical Entries,A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules in HPSG,A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules,A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules with Discourse Encoders

20,"Semantic grammars can be applied both as a language model for a speech recognizer and for semantic parsing, e.g. in order to map the output of a speech recognizer into formal meaning representations. Semantic speech recognition grammars are, however, typically created manually or learned in a supervised fashion, requiring extensive manual effort in both cases. Aiming to reduce this effort, in this paper we investigate the induction of semantic speech recognition grammars under weak supervision. We present empirical results, indicating that the induced grammars support semantic parsing of speech with a rather low loss in performance when compared to parsing of input without recognition errors. Further, we show improved parsing performance compared to applying n-gram models as language models and demonstrate how our semantic speech recognition grammars can be enhanced by weights based on occurrence frequencies, yielding an improvement in parsing performance over applying unweighted grammars.",Semantic parsing of speech using grammars learned with weak supervision,Weakly Supervised Induction of Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars,Weakly Supervised Induction of Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars,Weakly Supervised Induction of Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars for Semantic Parsing
21,"Bilingual lexicons are fundamental resources. Modern automated lexicon generation methods usually require parallel corpora, which are not available for most language pairs. Lexicons can be generated using non-parallel corpora or a pivot language, but such lexicons are noisy. We present an algorithm for generating a high quality lexicon from a noisy one, which only requires an independent corpus for each language. Our algorithm introduces non-aligned signatures (NAS), a cross-lingual word context similarity score that avoids the over-constrained and inefficient nature of alignment-based methods. We use NAS to eliminate incorrect translations from the generated lexicon. We evaluate our method by improving the quality of noisy Spanish-Hebrew lexicons generated from two pivot English lexicons. Our algorithm substantially outperforms other lexicon generation methods.",Bilingual Lexicon Generation Using Non-Aligned Signatures,Bilingual Lexicon Generation Using Non-Aligned Signatures,Generating Noisy Bilingual Lexicons with Non-aligned Signatures,Noisy Bilingual Lexicon Generation with Non-aligned Signatures

We present an efficient approximate approach for learning this environment model as part of a policygradient reinforcement learning algorithm for text interpretation.

23,"This paper investigates how hidden layers of deep rectifier networks are capable of transforming two or more pattern sets to be linearly separable while preserving the distances with a guaranteed degree, and proves the universal classification power of such distance preserving rectifier networks. Through the nearly isometric nonlinear transformation in the hidden layers, the margin of the linear separating plane in the output layer and the margin of the nonlinear separating boundary in the original data space can be closely related so that the maximum margin classification in the input data space can be achieved approximately via the maximum margin linear classifiers in the output layer. The generalization performance of such distance preserving deep rectifier neural networks can be well justified by the distance-preserving properties of their hidden layers and the maximum margin property of the linear classifiers in the output layer.",How Can Deep Rectifier Networks Achieve Linear Separability and Preserve Distances?,How Can Deep Rectifier Networks Achieve Linear Separability and Preserve Distances?,Deep Rectifier Neural Networks with Distance-Preserving Features,Nearly Isometric Distance Preserving Deep Rectifier Networks

Reliable cell tracking in time-lapse microscopic image sequences is important for modern biomedical research. Existing cell tracking methods are usually kept simple and use only a small number of features to allow for manual parameter tweaking or grid search. We propose a structured learning approach that allows to learn optimum parameters automatically from a training set. This allows for the use of a richer set of features which in turn affords improved tracking compared to recently reported methods on two public benchmark sequences.,Structured Learning for Cell Tracking,A Structured Learning Approach for Reliable Cell Tracking in Microscapes,Learning to Track a Large Number of Objects with Rich Features,Structured Learning for Cell Tracking
26,"We show that the state-of-the-art Transformer MT model is not biased towards monotonic reordering (unlike previous recurrent neural network models), but that nevertheless, long-distance dependencies remain a challenge for the model. Since most dependencies are short-distance, common evaluation metrics will be little influenced by how well systems perform on them. We therefore propose an automatic approach for extracting challenge sets rich with long-distance dependencies, and argue that evaluation using this methodology provides a complementary perspective on system performance. To support our claim, we compile challenge sets for English-German and German-English, which are much larger than any previously released challenge set for MT. The extracted sets are large enough to allow reliable automatic evaluation, which makes the proposed approach a scalable and practical solution for evaluating MT performance on the long-tail of syntactic phenomena.",Automatically Extracting Challenge Sets for Non-Local Phenomena in Neural Machine Translation, Extracting Challenge Sets Rich with Long-Distance Dependencies,Automatic Evaluation of Transformer MT on the Long Tail of Syntactic Phenomena,Automatic Evaluation of Transformer MT on Long-Distance Dependencies

We prove that dropout can suppress the strength of interactions between input variables of deep neural networks (DNNs). The theoretic proof is also verified by various experiments. Furthermore, we find that such interactions were strongly related to the over-fitting problem in deep learning. Thus, the utility of dropout can be regarded as decreasing interactions to alleviate the significance of over-fitting. Based on this understanding, we propose an interaction loss to further improve the utility of dropout. Experimental results have shown that the interaction loss can effectively improve the utility of dropout and boost the performance of DNNs.",Interpreting and Boosting Dropout from a Game-Theoretic View,The Utility of Dropout in Deep Neural Networks via Game-Theoretic Interactions,Dropout can suppress interactions between input variables of deep neural networks,Dropout and Interaction Loss in Deep Learning

The learned bases provide a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data point x on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination of its nearby anchor points, and the linear weights become its local coordinate coding. We show that a high dimensional nonlinear function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such coding. The method turns a difficult nonlinear learning problem into a simple global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks of traditional local learning methods.",Nonlinear Learning using Local Coordinate Coding,Semi-Supervised Learning on High Dimensional Nonlinear Manifolds,A Local Coordinate Coding Scheme for Semi-Supervised Learning on Nonlinear Manifolds,Local Coordinate Coding for Semi-Supervised Learning on High Dimensional Nonlinear Manifolds

Secondly, an AdaBoost model is used to rerank the revised candidates based on the information extracted from monolingual web pages. To get a better precision during the reranking process, a variety of web-based information is exploited to adjust the ranking score, so that some candidates which are less possible to be transliteration names will be assigned with lower ranks.

We formulate cross-domain semantic parsing as a domain adaptation problem: train a semantic parser on some source domains and then adapt it to the target domain. Due to the diversity of logical forms in different domains, this problem presents unique and intriguing challenges. By converting logical forms into canonical utterances in natural language, we reduce semantic parsing to paraphrasing, and develop an attentive sequence-to-sequence paraphrase model that is general and flexible to adapt to different domains. We discover two problems, small micro variance and large macro variance, of pre-trained word embeddings that hinder their direct use in neural networks, and propose standardization techniques as a remedy.

Unlike the vast majority of participating systems in 2012, our approach works over explicit and formal representations of propositional semantics, i.e. derives the notion of negation scope assumed in this task from the structure of logical-form meaning representations. We relate the task-specific interpretation of (negation) scope to the concept of (quantifier and operator) scope in mainstream underspecified semantics. With reference to an explicit encoding of semantic predicate-argument structure, we can operationalize the annotation decisions made for the 2012 *SEM task, and demonstrate how a comparatively simple system for negation scope resolution can be built from an off-the-shelf deep parsing system.

We propose a new model that conjoins features and word embeddings while maintaing a small number of parameters by learning feature embeddings jointly with the parameters of a compositional model. The result is a method that can scale to more features and more labels, while avoiding overfitting. We demonstrate that our model attains state-of-the-art results on ACE and ERE fine-grained relation extraction.",Combining Word Embeddings and Feature Embeddings for Fine-grained Relation Extraction,Joint Learning of Feature Embeddings and Word Embeddings for Fine-grained Relation Extraction,Learning Feature Embeddings for Compositional Embedding Models,Learning Feature Embeddings for Compositional Embedding Models
42,"We present a method for recognizing semantic role arguments using a kernel on weighted marked ordered labeled trees (the WMOLT kernel). We extend the kernels on marked ordered labeled trees (Kazama and Torisawa, 2005) so that the mark can be weighted according to its importance. We improve the accuracy by giving more weights on subtrees that contain the predicate and the argument nodes with this ability. Although Kazama and Torisawa (2005) presented fast training with tree kernels, the slow classification during runtime remained to be solved. In this paper, we give a solution that uses an efficient DP updating procedure applicable in argument recognition. We demonstrate that the WMOLT kernel improves the accuracy, and our speed-up method makes the recognition more than 40 times faster than the naive classification.",Semantic Role Recognition Using Kernels on Weighted Marked Ordered Labeled Trees,Semantic Role Recognition Using Kernels on Weighted Marked Ordered Labeled Trees,Fast Semantic Role Argument Recognition with Weighted Kernel on Weighted Marked Ordered Trees,WMOLT: Fast Semantic Role Argument Recognition on Weighted Marked Ordered Trees
43,"Parsing sentences to linguistically-expressive semantic representations is a key goal of Natural Language Processing. Yet statistical parsing has focussed almost exclusively on bilexical dependencies or domain-specific logical forms. We propose a neural encoder-decoder transition-based parser which is the first full-coverage semantic graph parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). The model architecture uses stack-based embedding features, predicting graphs jointly with unlexicalized predicates and their token alignments. Our parser is more accurate than attention-based baselines on MRS, and on an additional Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) benchmark, and GPU batch processing makes it an order of magnitude faster than a high-precision grammar-based parser. Further, the 86.69% Smatch score of our MRS parser is higher than the upper-bound on AMR parsing, making MRS an attractive choice as a semantic representation.",Robust Incremental Neural Semantic Graph Parsing,Full-coverage Semantic Graph Parsing for Minimal Recursion Semantics,A Neural Transition-based Parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics,A Neural Transition-Based Parser for Minimal-Recursion Semantics

Common dithering strategies for exploration, such as ‘-greedy, do not carry out temporally-extended (or deep) exploration; this can lead to exponentially larger data requirements. However, most algorithms for statistically e cient RL are not computationally tractable in complex environments. Randomized value functions o er a promising approach to e cient exploration with generalization, but existing algorithms are not compatible with nonlinearly parameterized value functions. As a first step towards addressing such contexts we develop bootstrapped DQN.

We corroborate prior findings that pro-independence tweets are more likely to include the local language than anti-independence tweets.

We propose a context-sensitive lexicon-based method based on a simple weighted-sum model, using a recurrent neural network to learn the sentiments strength, intensification and negation of lexicon sentiments in composing the sentiment value of sentences.

For example, how to solve the mismatch problem when applying an existing word segmenter to new data? Does a better word segmenter yield a better subsequent NLP task performance? In this work, we conduct an initial attempt to answer these questions on two related subsequent tasks: semantic slot filling in spoken language understanding and named entity recognition. We propose three techniques to solve the mismatch problem: using word segmentation outputs as additional features, adaptation with partial-learning and taking advantage of n-best word segmentation list.

In this paper, we formulate the data augmentation as a conditional generation task: generating a new sentence while preserving the original opinion targets and labels.

To achieve high parsing performance for spoken monologues, it could prove effective to simplify the structure by dividing a sentence into suitable language units. This paper proposes a method for dependency parsing of Japanese monologues based on sentence segmentation. In this method, the dependency parsing is executed in two stages: at the clause level and the sentence level. First, the dependencies within a clause are identified by dividing a sentence into clauses and executing stochastic dependency parsing for each clause. Next, the dependencies over clause boundaries are identified stochastically, and the dependency structure of the entire sentence is thus completed. An experiment using a spoken monologue corpus shows this method to be effective for efficient dependency parsing of Japanese monologue sentences.",Dependency Parsing of Japanese Spoken Monologue Based on Clause Boundaries,Dependency Parsing of Japanese Spoken Monologues Based on Sentence Segmentation,Sentence Segmentation for Dependency Parsing of Japanese Monologues,Sentence Segmentation for Dependency Parsing of Japanese Monologues

Unlike existing approaches to this task, we (1) classify an event-event or eventtime pair as one of the 14 temporal relations defined in the TimeBank corpus, rather than as one of the six relations collapsed from the original 14; (2) employ sophisticated linguistic knowledge derived from a variety of semantic and discourse relations, rather than focusing on morpho-syntactic knowledge; and (3) leverage a novel combination of rule-based and learning-based approaches, rather than relying solely on one or the other. Experiments with the TimeBank corpus demonstrate that our knowledge-rich, hybrid approach yields a 15–16% relative reduction in error over a state-of-the-art learning-based baseline system.",Classifying Temporal Relations with Rich Linguistic Knowledge,Classifying Temporal Relations with Rich Linguistic Knowledge,A Knowledge-Rich Hybrid Approach to Temporal Relation Classification,Knowledge-Rich Temporal Relation Classification

Unlike previous work, our final model does not require any additional resources at run-time. Compared to a state-ofthe-art approach, we achieve more than 20% relative error reduction. Additionally, we annotate a corpus of search queries with partof-speech tags, providing a resource for future work on syntactic query analysis.",Using Search-Logs to Improve Query Tagging,Part-of-Speech Tagging for Efficient Syntactic Query Analysis,Efficient Training of Syntactic Query Analysis Models with Part-of-Speech Tagging,Part-of-Speech Tagging for Efficient Syntactic Query Analysis

84,"One major challenge in training Deep Neural Networks is preventing overfitting. Many techniques such as data augmentation and novel regularizers such as Dropout have been proposed to prevent overfitting without requiring a massive amount of training data. In this work, we propose a new regularizer called DeCov which leads to significantly reduced overfitting (as indicated by the difference between train and val performance), and better generalization. Our regularizer encourages diverse or non-redundant representations in Deep Neural Networks by minimizing the cross-covariance of hidden activations. This simple intuition has been explored in a number of past works but surprisingly has never been applied as a regularizer in supervised learning. Experiments across a range of datasets and network architectures show that this loss always reduces overfitting while almost always maintaining or increasing generalization performance and often improving performance over Dropout.",Reducing Overfitting in Deep Networks by Decorrelating Representations,DeCov: Reducing Overfitting in Deep Neural Networks by Minimizing Cross-Covariance,DeCov: DeCov Regularization for Deep Neural Networks,DeCov: A Cross-Covariance Regularizer for Deep Neural Networks
85,"The task of inferring the native language of an author based on texts written in a second language has generally been tackled as a classification problem, typically using as features a mix of n-grams over characters and part of speech tags (for small and fixed n) and unigram function words. To capture arbitrarily long n-grams that syntax-based approaches have suggested are useful, adaptor grammars have some promise. In this work we investigate their extension to identifying n-gram collocations of arbitrary length over a mix of PoS tags and words, using both maxent and induced syntactic language model approaches to classification. After presenting a new, simple baseline, we show that learned collocations used as features in a maxent model perform better still, but that the story is more mixed for the syntactic language model.",Exploring Adaptor Grammars for Native Language Identification,Learning Adaptor Grammars for Native Language Inference from Second Language Texts,Learning to identify n-gram collocations for native language inference,Learning N-gram Collocations for Native Language Detection

93,"Information-theoretic measures are among the most standard techniques for evaluation of clustering methods including word sense induction (WSI) systems. Such measures rely on sample-based estimates of the entropy. However, the standard maximum likelihood estimates of the entropy are heavily biased with the bias dependent on, among other things, the number of clusters and the sample size. This makes the measures unreliable and unfair when the number of clusters produced by different systems vary and the sample size is not exceedingly large. This corresponds exactly to the setting of WSI evaluation where a ground-truth cluster sense number arguably does not exist and the standard evaluation scenarios use a small number of instances of each word to compute the score. We describe more accurate entropy estimators and analyze their performance both in simulations and on evaluation of WSI systems.",Improved Estimation of Entropy for Evaluation of Word Sense Induction,Evaluating Word Sense Induction Systems Using Entropy Estimation,Evaluating Word Sense Induction Systems with Large Sample Size and High-Bias Entropy Estimation,Better Entropy Estimation for Word Sense Induction Evaluation

Yet there is evidence that differences between annotators are not always random attention slips but could result from different biases towards the classification categories, at least for the harder-to-decide cases. Under an annotation generation model that takes this into account, there is a hazard that some of the training instances are actually hard cases with unreliable annotations. We show that these are relatively unproblematic for an algorithm operating under the 0-1 loss model, whereas for the commonly used voted perceptron algorithm, hard training cases could result in incorrect prediction on the uncontroversial cases at test time.",Learning with Annotation Noise,Hard Training Cases with Unreliable Annotation Generation,On the role of classification bias in annotating data,Hard Cases and Random Classifiers: Annotation Generation with Annotated Data

We would like to show that even a basic implementation of notions used in TR is enough to build an efficient machine learning system concerning the task of learning linguistic structures. ALLiS relies on the use of background knowledge and default values in order to build up an initial grammar and on the use of theory refinement in order to improve this grammar. This combination provides a good machine learning framework (efficient and fast) for Natural Language Learning.

However, the brittleness of existing neural net approaches is revealed by notable failures, such as the existence of adversarial examples that are misclassified despite being nearly identical to a training example, or the inability of recurrent sequence-processing nets to stay on track without teacher forcing. We introduce a method, which we refer to as state reification, that involves modeling the distribution of hidden states over the training data and then projecting hidden states observed during testing toward this distribution. Our intuition is that if the network can remain in a familiar manifold of hidden space, subsequent layers of the net should be well trained to respond appropriately.

Such text is prevalent online, in documents, social media, and message boards. We show that a feed-forward network with a simple globally constrained decoder can accurately and rapidly label both codemixed and monolingual text in 100 languages and 100 language pairs. This model outperforms previously published multilingual approaches in terms of both accuracy and speed, yielding an 800x speed-up and a 19.5% averaged absolute gain on three codemixed datasets. It furthermore outperforms several benchmark systems on monolingual language identification.","A Fast, Compact, Accurate Model for Language Identification of Codemixed Text","A Fast, Compact, Accurate Model for Language Identification of Codemixed Text",Fine-Grained Multilingual Language Identification with Feed-Forward Networks,Fine-Grained Multilingual Language Identification with Feed-Forward Networks
124,"We propose a generalized bootstrapping algorithm in which categories are described by relevant seed features. Our method introduces two unsupervised steps that improve the initial categorization step of the bootstrapping scheme: (i) using Latent Semantic space to obtain a generalized similarity measure between instances and features, and (ii) the Gaussian Mixture algorithm, to obtain uniform classification probabilities for unlabeled examples. The algorithm was evaluated on two Text Categorization tasks and obtained state-of-theart performance using only the category names as initial seeds.",Investigating Unsupervised Learning for Text Categorization Bootstrapping,Unsupervised Bootstrapping of Text Categories Using Latent Semantic Space and Gaussian Mixture,Unsupervised Bootstrapping of Text Categories Using Latent Semantic Space and Gaussian Mixture,Unsupervised Bootstrapping with Latent Semantic Space and Gaussian Mixture
125,"Datasets annotated with semantic roles are an important prerequisite to developing highperformance role labeling systems. Unfortunately, the reliance on manual annotations, which are both difficult and highly expensive to produce, presents a major obstacle to the widespread application of these systems across different languages and text genres. In this paper we describe a method for inducing the semantic roles of verbal arguments directly from unannotated text. We formulate the role induction problem as one of detecting alternations and finding a canonical syntactic form for them. Both steps are implemented in a novel probabilistic model, a latent-variable variant of the logistic classifier. Our method increases the purity of the induced role clusters by a wide margin over a strong baseline.",Unsupervised Induction of Semantic Roles,A Probabilistic Model for Semantic Role Induction from Unannotated Text,Semantic Role Induction from Unannotated Text,A Probabilistic Model for Inducing Semantic Roles from Text

127,"We take up the scientific question of what determines the preferred order of adjectives in English, in phrases such as big blue box where multiple adjectives modify a following noun. We implement and test four quantitative theories, all of which are theoretically motivated in terms of efficiency in human language production and comprehension. The four theories we test are subjectivity (Scontras et al., 2017), information locality (Futrell, 2019), integration cost (Dyer, 2017), and information gain, which we introduce. We evaluate theories based on their ability to predict orders of unseen adjectives in hand-parsed and automatically-parsed dependency treebanks. We find that subjectivity, information locality, and information gain are all strong predictors, with some evidence for a two-factor account, where subjectivity and information gain reflect a factor involving semantics, and information locality reflects collocational preferences.",What determines the order of adjectives in English?

129,"We investigate a new optimization problem involving minimizing the Ratio of two Submodular (RS) functions. We argue that this problem occurs naturally in several real world applications. We then show the connection between this problem and several related problems including minimizing the difference between submodular functions (Iyer & Bilmes, 2012b; Narasimhan & Bilmes, 2005), and to submodular optimization subject to submodular constraints (Iyer & Bilmes, 2013). We show that RS optimization can be solved with bounded approximation factors. We also provide a hardness bound and show that our tightest algorithm matches the lower bound up to a log factor. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance and good scalability properties of our algorithms.",Algorithms for Optimizing the Ratio of Submodular Functions,Algorithms for Optimizing the Ratio of Submodular Functions,Minimizing the Ratio of Two Submodular Functions,Minimizing the Ratio of Two Submodular Functions

Beyond linguistic cues and lexical information, our approach exploits compositional semantics and segment discourse structure data. We report a statistically significant improvement in classifying relations over attribute-value learning paradigms such as Decision Trees, RIPPER and Naive Bayes. For discourse parsing, our modified shift-reduce parsing model that uses our relation classifier significantly outperforms a right-branching majority-class baseline.",An effective Discourse Parser that uses Rich Linguistic Information,An effective Discourse Parser that uses Rich Linguistic Information,A Logic-Based Approach to Discourse Relations Classification,A Logic-Based Approach to Discourse Relation Classification
131,"Website privacy policies represent the single most important source of information for users to gauge how their personal data are collected, used and shared by companies. However, privacy policies are often vague and people struggle to understand the content. Their opaqueness poses a significant challenge to both users and policy regulators. In this paper, we seek to identify vague content in privacy policies. We construct the first corpus of human-annotated vague words and sentences and present empirical studies on automatic vagueness detection. In particular, we investigate context-aware and context-agnostic models for predicting vague words, and explore auxiliary-classifier generative adversarial networks for characterizing sentence vagueness. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches. Finally, we provide suggestions for resolving vagueness and improving the usability of privacy policies.",Automatic Detection of Vague Words and Sentences in Privacy Policies,Automatic Detection of Vague Words and Sentences in Privacy Policies,Automatic Vagueness Detection in Privacy Policies,Detecting Vagueness in Privacy Policies: A Case Study on the Case of Web Privacy Policies
132,"We study a novel architecture for syntactic SMT. In contrast to the dominant approach in the literature, the system does not rely on translation rules, but treat translation as an unconstrained target sentence generation task, using soft features to capture lexical and syntactic correspondences between the source and target languages. Target syntax features and bilingual translation features are trained consistently in a discriminative model. Experiments using the IWSLT 2010 dataset show that the system achieves BLEU comparable to the state-of-the-art syntactic SMT systems.",Syntactic SMT Using a Discriminative Text Generation Model,Syntactic SMT Using a Discriminative Text Generation Model,Syntactic SMT: Unconstrained Target Sentence Generation with Soft Features,Syntactic SMT with Bilingual Translation
133,"Distant supervision usually utilizes only unlabeled data and existing knowledge bases to learn relation extraction models. However, in some cases a small amount of human labeled data is available. In this paper, we demonstrate how a state-of-theart multi-instance multi-label model can be modified to make use of these reliable sentence-level labels in addition to the relation-level distant supervision from a database. Experiments show that our approach achieves a statistically significant increase of 13.5% in F-score and 37% in area under the precision recall curve.",Infusion of Labeled Data into Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction, Improving Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction,Learning Relation Extraction from Distant Supervision with Multi-Instance Multi-label Models,Learning Relation Extraction from Distant Supervision with Multi-Instance Labels
134,"Information Gain is a well-known and empirically proven method for high-dimensional feature selection. We found that it and other existing methods failed to produce good results on an industrial text classification problem. On investigating the root cause, we find that a large class of feature scoring methods suffers a pitfall: they can be blinded by a surplus of strongly predictive features for some classes, while largely ignoring features needed to discriminate difficult classes. In this paper we demonstrate this pitfall hurts performance even for a relatively uniform text classification task. Based on this understanding, we present solutions inspired by round-robin scheduling that avoid this pitfall, without resorting to costly wrapper methods. Empirical evaluation on 19 datasets shows substantial improvements.",A Pitfall and Solution in Multi-Class Feature Selection for Text Classification ,A Pitfall and Solution in Multi-Class Feature Selection for Text Classification ,Information Gain: A Pitfall-Based Approach to Text Classification,Information Gain and Round-robin Scheduling for Text Classification
135,"Knowledge bases are useful resources for many natural language processing tasks, however, they are far from complete. In this paper, we define a novel entity representation as a mixture of its neighborhood in the knowledge base and apply this technique on TransE—a well-known embedding model for knowledge base completion. Experimental results show that the neighborhood information significantly helps to improve the results of the TransE, leading to better performance than obtained by other state-of-the-art embedding models on three benchmark datasets for triple classification, entity prediction and relation prediction tasks.",Neighborhood Mixture Model for Knowledge Base Completion,Neighborhood Mixture Model for Knowledge Base Completion,Neighborhood Information for Knowledge Base Completion,Neighborhood Information for Knowledge Base Completion
136,"Interacting with relational databases through natural language helps users with any background easily query and analyze a vast amount of data. This requires a system that understands users' questions and converts them to SQL queries automatically. In this paper, we present a novel approach TypeSQL which formats the problem as a slot filling task in a more reasonable way. In addition, TypeSQL utilizes type information to better understand rare entities and numbers in the questions. We experiment this idea on the WikiSQL dataset and outperform the prior art by 6% in much shorter time. We also show that accessing the content of databases can significantly improve the performance when users' queries are not well-formed. TypeSQL can reach 82.6% accuracy, a 17.5% absolute improvement compared to the previous content-sensitive model.",TypeSQL: Knowledge-Based Type-Aware Neural Text-to-SQL Generation,TypeSQL: A Slot Filling Approach to Interacting with Relational Databases,TypeSQL: A Slot Filling Task for Natural Language Queries,TypeSQL: A Slot Filling Task for Natural Language Queries
137,"Constituent parsing is typically modeled by a chart-based algorithm under probabilistic context-free grammars or by a transition-based algorithm with rich features. Previous models rely heavily on richer syntactic information through lexicalizing rules, splitting categories, or memorizing long histories. However enriched models incur numerous parameters and sparsity issues, and are insufficient for capturing various syntactic phenomena. We propose a neural network structure that explicitly models the unbounded history of actions performed on the stack and queue employed in transition-based parsing, in addition to the representations of partially parsed tree structure. Our transition-based neural constituent parsing achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art parsers, demonstrating F1 score of 90.68% for English and 84.33% for Chinese, without reranking, feature templates or additional data to train model parameters.",Transition-based Neural Constituent Parsing,Transition-based Neural Constituent Parsing,Transition-based Neural Constituent Parsing with Neural Networks,Transition-Based Neural Constituent Parsing
138,"Distributed stochastic gradient descent is an important subroutine in distributed learning. A setting of particular interest is when the clients are mobile devices, where two important concerns are communication efficiency and the privacy of the clients. Several recent works have focused on reducing the communication cost or introducing privacy guarantees, but none of the proposed communication efficient methods are known to be privacy preserving and none of the known privacy mechanisms are known to be communication efficient. To this end, we study algorithms that achieve both communication efficiency and differential privacy. For d variables and n ⇡ d clients, the proposed method uses O(log log(nd)) bits of communication per client per coordinate and ensures constant privacy. We also improve previous analysis of the Binomial mechanism showing that it achieves nearly the same utility as the Gaussian mechanism, while requiring fewer representation bits, which can be of independent interest.",cpSGD: Communication-efficient and differentially-private distributed SGD,Communication Efficiency and Differential Privacy for Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent,Communication and Privacy in Distributed Gradient Descent,Communication-Privacy Interactions in Distributed Gradient Descent
139,"At AAAI’07, Zinkevich, Bowling and Burch introduced the Range of Skill measure of a two-player game and used it as a parameter in the analysis of the running time of an algorithm for finding approximate solutions to such games. They suggested that the Range of Skill of a typical natural game is a small number, but only gave heuristic arguments for this. In this paper, we provide the first methods for rigorously estimating the Range of Skill of a given game. We provide some general, asymptotic bounds that imply that the Range of Skill of a perfectly balanced game tree is almost exponential in its size (and doubly exponential in its depth). We also provide techniques that yield concrete bounds for unbalanced game trees and apply these to estimate the Range of Skill of Tic-Tac-Toe and Heads-Up Limit Texas Hold’em Poker. In particular, we show that the Range of Skill of Tic-Tac-Toe is more than 100,000.",On Range of Skill,Estimating the Range of Skill of a Natural Game Tree,Estimating the Range of Skill of a Natural Game,Estimating the Range of Skill of Games
