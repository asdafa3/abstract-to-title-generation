# Abstract to Title Generation

This project is based on a bachelor [thesis](https://github.com/Xieyichen/Thesis) that aims on automatically generating titles from paper abstracts. This is done using different generator models (bart-base, bart-cnn, bart-xsum, gpt2, t5 and pegasus-xsum) to generate titles a reward model to score titles trained on human annotations and a reinforcement learning environment to optimize that model for better text generation.
