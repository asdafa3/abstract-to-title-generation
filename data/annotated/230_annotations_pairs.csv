0,"Zero-shot translation, translating between language pairs on which a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system has never been trained, is an emergent property when training the system in multilingual settings. However, naive training for zero-shot NMT easily fails, and is sensitive to hyper-parameter setting. The performance typically lags far behind the more conventional pivot-based approach which translates twice using a third language as a pivot. In this work, we address the degeneracy problem due to capturing spurious correlations by quantitatively analyzing the mutual information between language IDs of the source and decoded sentences. Inspired by this analysis, we propose to use two simple but effective approaches: (1) decoder pre-training; (2) back-translation. These methods show significant improvement (4 22 BLEU points) over the vanilla zero-shot translation on three challenging multilingual datasets, and achieve similar or better results than the pivot-based approach.",Improved Zero-shot Neural Machine Translation via Ignoring Spurious Correlations,,Zero-Shot Neural Machine Translation as a Pivot-Based Degeneration of Spurious Correlation between Source and Target Decoding,Pre-training and Back-translation for Zero-Shot Neural Machine Translation in Multilingual Settings,Null-Shot Translation with Decoder Pre-training and Back-Translation, Neural Machine Translation with Arbitrary Correlations,Decoupling the Source Language and the Target Language for Zero-Shot Neural Machine Translation
1,"Biomedical named entities often play important roles in many biomedical text mining tools. However, due to the incompleteness of provided synonyms and numerous variations in their surface forms, normalization of biomedical entities is very challenging. In this paper, we focus on learning representations of biomedical entities solely based on the synonyms of entities. To learn from the incomplete synonyms, we use a model-based candidate selection and maximize the marginal likelihood of the synonyms present in top candidates. Our model-based candidates are iteratively updated to contain more difficult negative samples as our model evolves. In this way, we avoid the explicit pre-selection of negative samples from more than 400K candidates. On four biomedical entity normalization datasets having three different entity types (disease, chemical, adverse reaction), our model BioSyn consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art models almost reaching the upper bound on each dataset.",Biomedical Entity Representations with Synonym Marginalization,Modeling Biomedical Named Entity Normalization with Incomplete Synonyms,,Biomedical Entity Normalization based on the Synonym Selection of Entities,Learning Representations of Biomedical Entities based on Synonyms, Learning Representations of Biomedical Entities Based on Synonyms,Learning Representations of Biomedical Named Entities from Incomplete Synonyms
2,"By describing the features and abstractions of our world, language is a crucial tool for human learning and a promising source of supervision for machine learning models. We use language to improve few-shot visual classification in the underexplored scenario where natural language task descriptions are available during training, but unavailable for novel tasks at test time. Existing models for this setting sample new descriptions at test time and use those to classify images. Instead, we propose language-shaped learning (LSL), an end-to-end model that regularizes visual representations to predict language. LSL is conceptually simpler, more data efficient, and outperforms baselines in two challenging few-shot domains.",Shaping Visual Representations with Language for Few-Shot Classification,Language-shaped Learning for Few-Shot Visual Classification,Language-Shared Few-shot Visual Classification with End-to-End Modeling of Natural Language Descriptors and Abstract,Language-Shaped Learning for Few-Shot Visual Classification,Language-shaped Learning for Few-Shot Visual Classification,,Language-Shaped Learning for Few-Shot Visual Classification
3,"The paper presents an approach to ellipsis resolution in a framework of scope underspecification (Underspecified Discourse Representation Theory). It is argued that the approach improves on previous proposals to integrate ellipsis resolution and scope underspecification (Crouch, 1995; Egg et al., 2001) in that application processes like anaphora resolution do not require full disambiguation but can work directly on the underspecified representation. Furthermore it is shown that the approach presented can cope with the examples discussed by Dalrymple et al. (1991) as well as a problem noted recently by Erk and Koller (2001).",Ellipsis Resolution with Underspecified Scope,E ellipsis resolution and scope underspecification in Underspecified Discourse Representations,Ellipsis Resolution in Underspecified Discourse Representation Theory: An Approach to Ellipsis and Scope Und,,A Framework for ellipsis resolution in scope underspecification, Anaphora Resolution and Scope Underspecification,ellipsis Resolution in an Underspecified Discourse Representation

In this paper, we present novel methods for calculating separate lexical and syntactic surprisal measures from a single incremental parser using a lexicalized PCFG. We also present an approximation to entropy measures that would otherwise be intractable to calculate for a grammar of that size.

This family extends the partitioned logistic normal distribution, enabling factored covariance between the probabilities of different derivation events in the probabilistic grammar, providing a new way to encode prior knowledge about an unknown grammar. We describe a variational EM algorithm for learning a probabilistic grammar based on this family of priors.

6,"We analyze human's disagreements about the validity of natural language inferences. We show that, very often, disagreements are not dismissible as annotation ""noise"", but rather persist as we collect more ratings and as we vary the amount of context provided to raters. We further show that the type of uncertainty captured by current state-of-the-art models for natural language inference is not reflective of the type of uncertainty present in human disagreements. We discuss implications of our results in relation to the recognizing textual entailment (RTE)/natural language inference (NLI) task.

7,"This paper describes an algorithm for detecting empty nodes in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), finding their antecedents, and assigning them function tags, without access to lexical information such as valency. Unlike previous approaches to this task, the current method is not corpus-based, but rather makes use of the principles of early Government-Binding theory (Chomsky, 1981), the syntactic theory that underlies the annotation. Using the evaluation metric proposed by Johnson (2002), this approach outperforms previously published approaches on both detection of empty categories and antecedent identification, given either annotated input stripped of empty categories or the output of a parser. Some problems with this evaluation metric are noted and an alternative is proposed along with the results. The paper considers the reasons a principlebased approach to this problem should outperform corpus-based approaches, and speculates on the possibility of a hybrid approach.",Using Linguistic Principles to Recover Empty Categories,An Evaluation Metric for Empty Node Detection in Penn Treebank,A Corpus-Based Approach to the Automatic Discovery of Empty Categories and Their Antecedents in the Penn Treebank: An,A Principle-Based Approach to Empty Categories in the Penn Treebank,, Detecting Empty Categories and Antecedents in the Penn Treebank,A Principle-Based Approach to Empty Node Detection in the Penn Treebank
8,"When a word sense disambiguation (WSD) system is trained on one domain but applied to a different domain, a drop in accuracy is frequently observed. This highlights the importance of domain adaptation for word sense disambiguation. In this paper, we first show that an active learning approach can be successfully used to perform domain adaptation of WSD systems. Then, by using the predominant sense predicted by expectation-maximization (EM) and adopting a count-merging technique, we improve the effectiveness of the original adaptation process achieved by the basic active learning approach.",Domain Adaptation with Active Learning for Word Sense Disambiguation,Active Learning for Domain Adaptation of Word Sense Disambiguation Systems,Active Domain Adaptation for Word Sense Disambiguation Using Expectation-Maximization Prediction and Count-Merging Techniques,Domain Adaptation of Word Sense Disambiguation Systems,Active Domain Adaptation for Word Sense Disambiguation, Domain Adaptation for Word Sense Disambiguation,

Therefore, it is no surprise that the health domain is a valuable area of interest for emotion detection, as it can provide medical staff or caregivers with essential information about patients. However, progress on this task has been hampered by the absence of large labeled datasets. To this end, we introduce CancerEmo, an emotion dataset created from an online health community and annotated with eight fine-grained emotions. We perform a comprehensive analysis of these emotions and develop deep learning models on the newly created dataset.

12,"Much of human dialogue occurs in semi-cooperative settings, where agents with different goals attempt to agree on common decisions. Negotiations require complex communication and reasoning skills, but success is easy to measure, making this an interesting task for AI. We gather a large dataset of human-human negotiations on a multi-issue bargaining task, where agents who cannot observe each other's reward functions must reach an agreement (or a deal) via natural language dialogue. For the first time, we show it is possible to train end-to-end models for negotiation, which must learn both linguistic and reasoning skills with no annotated dialogue states. We also introduce dialogue rollouts, in which the model plans ahead by simulating possible complete continuations of the conversation, and find that this technique dramatically improves performance.

The approach is based on a Gaussian observation model and Gaussian priors with bilinear equality and inequality constraints. We present an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo inference procedure based on Gibbs sampling. Special cases of the proposed model are Bayesian formulations of nonnegative matrix factorization and factor analysis. The method is evaluated on a blind source separation problem. We demonstrate that our algorithm can be used to extract meaningful and interpretable features that are remarkably different from features extracted using existing related matrix factorization techniques.,Linearly constrained Bayesian matrix factorization for blind source separation,Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization with Linear Constraints,Bayesian Matrix Factorization with Gaussian Priors and Gibbs Sampling Based on Gaussian Observation for Nonnegative Matrix Factor,,Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization Subject to Linear Constraints, Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization,Probabilistic Matrix Factorization with Linear Constraints

Our work considers predicting missing entities (link prediction) and missing time intervals (time prediction) as joint Temporal Knowledge Base Completion (TKBC) tasks, and presents TIMEPLEX, a novel TKBC method, in which entities, relations and, time are all embedded in a uniform, compatible space. TIMEPLEX exploits the recurrent nature of some facts/events and temporal interactions between pairs of relations, yielding state-of-the-art results on both prediction tasks. We also find that existing TKBC models heavily overestimate link prediction performance due to imperfect evaluation mechanisms. In response, we propose improved TKBC evaluation protocols for both link and time prediction tasks, dealing with subtle issues that arise from the partial overlap of time intervals in gold instances and system predictions.",Temporal Knowledge Base Completion: New Algorithms and Evaluation Protocols,Temporal Knowledge Base Completion with Missing Entities and Time Intervals,,TIMEPLEX: Joint Entity and Time Prediction for Temporal Knowledge Base Completion,TIMEPLEX: Joint Temporal Knowledge Base Completion, Joint Temporal Knowledge Base Completion and Time Prediction,Time: A Joint Temporal Knowledge Base Completion Method for Link and Time Prediction

A compiler is described which translates a set of lexical rules and their interaction into a definite clause encoding, which is called by the base lexical entries in the lexicon. This way, the disjunctive possibilities arising from lexical rule application are encoded as systematic covariation in the specification of lexical entries. The compiler ensures the automatic transfer of properties not changed by a lexical rule. Program transformation techniques are used to advance the encoding. The final output of the compiler constitutes an efficient computational counterpart of the linguistic generalizations captured by lexical rules and allows on-the-fly application of lexical rules.",A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules in HPSG as Covariation in Lexical Entries,A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules in HPSG,A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules in HPSG-based Lexical Grammars for Linguistic Generalization,A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules and their Interactions,, A Computational Approach to Lexical Rules,Computational Covariation of Lexical Rules in HPSG

20,"Semantic grammars can be applied both as a language model for a speech recognizer and for semantic parsing, e.g. in order to map the output of a speech recognizer into formal meaning representations. Semantic speech recognition grammars are, however, typically created manually or learned in a supervised fashion, requiring extensive manual effort in both cases. Aiming to reduce this effort, in this paper we investigate the induction of semantic speech recognition grammars under weak supervision. We present empirical results, indicating that the induced grammars support semantic parsing of speech with a rather low loss in performance when compared to parsing of input without recognition errors. Further, we show improved parsing performance compared to applying n-gram models as language models and demonstrate how our semantic speech recognition grammars can be enhanced by weights based on occurrence frequencies, yielding an improvement in parsing performance over applying unweighted grammars.",Semantic parsing of speech using grammars learned with weak supervision,Weakly Supervised Induction of Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars,Inducing Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars under Weak Supervision for Improved Parsing and Semantic Parsing of Speech,Weakly Supervised Induction of Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars,Learning Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars under weak supervision, Improving Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars with Weak Supervision,

Lexicons can be generated using non-parallel corpora or a pivot language, but such lexicons are noisy.

Through the nearly isometric nonlinear transformation in the hidden layers, the margin of the linear separating plane in the output layer and the margin of the nonlinear separating boundary in the original data space can be closely related so that the maximum margin classification in the input data space can be achieved approximately via the maximum margin linear classifiers in the output layer.

Reliable cell tracking in time-lapse microscopic image sequences is important for modern biomedical research. Existing cell tracking methods are usually kept simple and use only a small number of features to allow for manual parameter tweaking or grid search. We propose a structured learning approach that allows to learn optimum parameters automatically from a training set. This allows for the use of a richer set of features which in turn affords improved tracking compared to recently reported methods on two public benchmark sequences.,Structured Learning for Cell Tracking,A Structured Learning Approach for Reliable Cell Tracking in Microscapes,Structured Learning for Reliable Cell Tracking in Microscaling Time-Lapse Microscapes: A Structured Learning Approach,Structured Learning for Cell Tracking in Time-Lapse Microscopic Images,Learning to Track a Large Quantity of Homogeneous Objects, Structured Learning for Cell Tracking in Time-Lapse Microarray Sequences,

Since most dependencies are short-distance, common evaluation metrics will be little influenced by how well systems perform on them. We therefore propose an automatic approach for extracting challenge sets rich with long-distance dependencies, and argue that evaluation using this methodology provides a complementary perspective on system performance. To support our claim, we compile challenge sets for English-German and German-English, which are much larger than any previously released challenge set for MT. The extracted sets are large enough to allow reliable automatic evaluation, which makes the proposed approach a scalable and practical solution for evaluating MT performance on the long-tail of syntactic phenomena.",Automatically Extracting Challenge Sets for Non-Local Phenomena in Neural Machine Translation,Towards Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation Systems,Evaluating Machine Translation with Long-distance Dependencies: An Automatic Approach to the State-of-the-Art Trans,,Extraction of Challenge Sets with Long-Distance Dependencies, Extracting Challenge Sets Rich with Long-Distance Dependencies,Automatic Evaluation of Long-Tailed Syntactic Challenges for Transformer MT

We prove that dropout can suppress the strength of interactions between input variables of deep neural networks (DNNs). The theoretic proof is also verified by various experiments. Furthermore, we find that such interactions were strongly related to the over-fitting problem in deep learning. Thus, the utility of dropout can be regarded as decreasing interactions to alleviate the significance of over-fitting. Based on this understanding, we propose an interaction loss to further improve the utility of dropout.

The learned bases provide a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data point x on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination of its nearby anchor points, and the linear weights become its local coordinate coding. We show that a high dimensional nonlinear function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such coding. The method turns a difficult nonlinear learning problem into a simple global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks of traditional local learning methods.",Nonlinear Learning using Local Coordinate Coding,Local Coordinate Coding for Semi-Supervised Nonlinear Manifolds,,A Local Coordinate Coding Scheme for Semi-Supervised Learning on Nonlinear Manifolds,Semi-Supervised Learning on High Dimensional Nonlinear Manifolds, Semi-Supervised Learning on High Dimensional Nonlinear Manifolds,Global Linear Programming for Semi-Supervised Learning on High Dimensional Manifolds

34,"In this paper, we present a novel backward transliteration approach which can further assist the existing statistical model by mining monolingual web resources. Firstly, we employ the syllable-based search to revise the transliteration candidates from the statistical model. By mapping all of them into existing words, we can filter or correct some pseudo candidates and improve the overall recall. Secondly, an AdaBoost model is used to rerank the revised candidates based on the information extracted from monolingual web pages. To get a better precision during the reranking process, a variety of web-based information is exploited to adjust the ranking score, so that some candidates which are less possible to be transliteration names will be assigned with lower ranks. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can significantly outperform the baseline transliteration system in both precision and recall.",Chinese-English Backward Transliteration Assisted with Mining Monolingual Web Pages,Recovering Transliteration Candidates from Monolingual Web Pages for Statistical Machine Translation,Backward Transliteration with Syllable-Based Search Based on Web-based Information Extraction from Monolingual Web,A Novel Backward Transliteration Approach Using Syllable-based Search and Monolingual Web Resources,, Forward Transliteration for Statistical Machine Translation,Exploiting Monolingual Web Resources for Better Recall and Ranking
35,"Existing studies on semantic parsing mainly focus on the in-domain setting. We formulate cross-domain semantic parsing as a domain adaptation problem: train a semantic parser on some source domains and then adapt it to the target domain. Due to the diversity of logical forms in different domains, this problem presents unique and intriguing challenges. By converting logical forms into canonical utterances in natural language, we reduce semantic parsing to paraphrasing, and develop an attentive sequence-to-sequence paraphrase model that is general and flexible to adapt to different domains. We discover two problems, small micro variance and large macro variance, of pre-trained word embeddings that hinder their direct use in neural networks, and propose standardization techniques as a remedy. On the popular Overnight dataset, which contains eight domains, we show that both cross-domain training and standardized pre-trained word embeddings can bring significant improvement.",Cross-domain Semantic Parsing via Paraphrasing,Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing as Domain Adaptation,Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing as Domain Adaptation with Paraphrasing and Pre-Trained Word Embeddings,,Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing as a Domain adaptation problem, Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing as a Domain Adaptation Problem,Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing with Pre-trained Word Embedding
36,The paper introduces a penalized matrix estimation procedure aiming at solutions which are sparse and low-rank at the same time. Such structures arise in the context of social networks or protein interactions where underlying graphs have adjacency matrices which are block-diagonal in the appropriate basis. We introduce a convex mixed penalty which involves `1-norm and trace norm simultaneously. We obtain an oracle inequality which indicates how the two effects interact according to the nature of the target matrix. We bound generalization error in the link prediction problem. We also develop proximal descent strategies to solve the optimization problem efficiently and evaluate performance on synthetic and real data sets.,Estimation of Simultaneously Sparse and Low Rank Matrices.,A Convex Mixed Penalty for Sparse and Low-Rank Matrix Estimation,A Convex Mixed Penalties for Sparse and Low-Rank Matrix Estimation with Application to Protein Interaction Problems.,,A Penalized Matrix Estimation Procedure for Protein Interactions, A Convex Mixed Penalty for Link Prediction,Sparse and Low-Rank Matrix Estimation via Convex Mixed Penalties
37,"In this work, we revisit Shared Task 1 from the 2012 *SEM Conference: the automated analysis of negation. Unlike the vast majority of participating systems in 2012, our approach works over explicit and formal representations of propositional semantics, i.e. derives the notion of negation scope assumed in this task from the structure of logical-form meaning representations. We relate the task-specific interpretation of (negation) scope to the concept of (quantifier and operator) scope in mainstream underspecified semantics. With reference to an explicit encoding of semantic predicate-argument structure, we can operationalize the annotation decisions made for the 2012 *SEM task, and demonstrate how a comparatively simple system for negation scope resolution can be built from an off-the-shelf deep parsing system. In a system combination setting, our approach improves over the best published results on this task to date.",Simple Negation Scope Resolution through Deep Parsing: A Semantic Solution to a Semantic Problem,,Revisiting Shared Task 1: Negation Scope Resolution in Underspecified Semantics with Logical-Form Meaning Represent,Automated Negation Scope Resolution over Explicit and Formal Semantics,Shared Task 1: the Automated Analyse of Negation, Automatic Interpretation of Negation Scope,Revisiting Shared Task 1 from the 2012 *SEM Conference: The Automated Analysis of Negation Scope

Yet statistical parsing has focussed almost exclusively on bilexical dependencies or domain-specific logical forms. We propose a neural encoder-decoder transition-based parser which is the first full-coverage semantic graph parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). The model architecture uses stack-based embedding features, predicting graphs jointly with unlexicalized predicates and their token alignments. Our parser is more accurate than attention-based baselines on MRS, and on an additional Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) benchmark, and GPU batch processing makes it an order of magnitude faster than a high-precision grammar-based parser. Further, the 86.69% Smatch score of our MRS parser is higher than the upper-bound on AMR parsing, making MRS an attractive choice as a semantic representation.",Robust Incremental Neural Semantic Graph Parsing,Neural Transition-based Semantic Graph Parsing for Minimal Recursion Semantics,Neural Encoder-Decoder Transition-based Parsing of Minimal Recursion Semantic Parsers for Natural Language Processing,A Neural Transition-based Parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics,Full-coverage Semantic Graph Parsing for Minimal Recursion Semantics, Neural Decoding for Minimal Recursion Semantics,

Common dithering strategies for exploration, such as ‘-greedy, do not carry out temporally-extended (or deep) exploration; this can lead to exponentially larger data requirements. However, most algorithms for statistically e cient RL are not computationally tractable in complex environments. Randomized value functions o er a promising approach to e cient exploration with generalization, but existing algorithms are not compatible with nonlinearly parameterized value functions. As a first step towards addressing such contexts we develop bootstrapped DQN.

These language models are almost universally autoregressive in nature, generating sentences one token at a time from left to right. This paper studies the influence of token generation order on model quality via a novel two-pass language model that produces partially-filled sentence ""templates"" and then fills in missing tokens. We compare various strategies for structuring these two passes and observe a surprisingly large variation in model quality. We find the most effective strategy generates function words in the first pass followed by content words in the second.

In this work, we conduct an initial attempt to answer these questions on two related subsequent tasks: semantic slot filling in spoken language understanding and named entity recognition. We propose three techniques to solve the mismatch problem: using word segmentation outputs as additional features, adaptation with partial-learning and taking advantage of n-best word segmentation list.

While data augmentation is potentially an effective technique to address the above issue, it is uncontrollable as it may change aspect words and aspect labels unexpectedly. In this paper, we formulate the data augmentation as a conditional generation task: generating a new sentence while preserving the original opinion targets and labels. We propose a masked sequence-to-sequence method for conditional augmentation of aspect term extraction. Unlike existing augmentation approaches, ours is controllable and allows to generate more diversified sentences.

58,"Spoken monologues feature greater sentence length and structural complexity than do spoken dialogues. To achieve high parsing performance for spoken monologues, it could prove effective to simplify the structure by dividing a sentence into suitable language units. This paper proposes a method for dependency parsing of Japanese monologues based on sentence segmentation. In this method, the dependency parsing is executed in two stages: at the clause level and the sentence level. First, the dependencies within a clause are identified by dividing a sentence into clauses and executing stochastic dependency parsing for each clause. Next, the dependencies over clause boundaries are identified stochastically, and the dependency structure of the entire sentence is thus completed. An experiment using a spoken monologue corpus shows this method to be effective for efficient dependency parsing of Japanese monologue sentences.",Dependency Parsing of Japanese Spoken Monologue Based on Clause Boundaries,Dependency Parsing of Japanese Monologues Based on Sentence Segmentation,Dependency Parsing of Japanese Monologue Sentences Using Sentence Segmentation and Stochastic Dependency Parser,Sentence Segmentation for Dependency Parsing of Japanese Monologues,, Dependency Parsing of Japanese Monologues Using Sentence Segmentation,Dependency Parsing of Japanese Spoken Monologues Based on Sentence Segmentation

Understanding the correct meaning of a syntactic form is of great importance to many NLP applications.

It approximates the nonnegative data in an original high dimensional space with a linear representation in a low dimensional space by using the product of two nonnegative matrices. In many applications with data such as human faces or digits, data often reside on multiple manifolds, which may overlap or intersect. But the traditional NMF method and other existing variants of NMF do not consider this. This paper proposes a novel clustering algorithm that explicitly models the intrinsic geometrical structure of the data on multiple manifolds with NMF. The idea of the proposed algorithm is that a data point generated by several neighboring points on a specific manifold in the original space should be constructed in a similar way in the low dimensional subspace. A set of experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm.",Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Clustering on Multiple Manifolds,Multi-Manifold Nonnegative Matrix Factorization.,Nonnegative Matrix Factorization on Manifolds with Intrinsic Geometrical Structure for Multiple Manifold Manif,Clustering on Multiple Manifolds with Nonnegative Matrix Factorization,Clustering Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for High Dimensional Space,,Clustering on Multiple Manifolds with Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
71,"We present two language models based upon an “immediate-head” parser — our name for a parser that conditions all events below a constituent c upon the head of c. While all of the most accurate statistical parsers are of the immediate-head variety, no previous grammatical language model uses this technology. The perplexity for both of these models significantly improve upon the trigram model base-line as well as the best previous grammarbased language model. For the better of our two models these improvements are 24% and 14% respectively. We also suggest that improvement of the underlying parser should significantly improve the model’s perplexity and that even in the near term there is a lot of potential for improvement in immediatehead language models.",Immediate-Head Parsing for Language Models,Improvements in an Immediate-Head Language Model Based on a Grammatical Parser,Parsing with an Immediate-Head Parser and its Application to the trigram base-line Grammatical language model,An Immediate-Head Parser for Statistical Language Models,, Improving Grammatical Language Modeling by Immediate-Heading Parsing,Two Immediate-Head Grammatical Language Models
72,"Scoring sentences in documents given abstract summaries created by humans is important in extractive multi-document summarization. In this paper, we formulate extractive summarization as a two step learning problem building a generative model for pattern discovery and a regression model for inference. We calculate scores for sentences in document clusters based on their latent characteristics using a hierarchical topic model. Then, using these scores, we train a regression model based on the lexical and structural characteristics of the sentences, and use the model to score sentences of new documents to form a summary. Our system advances current state-of-the-art improving ROUGE scores by ∼7%.

74,"Neural encoder-decoder models have been successful in natural language generation tasks. However, real applications of abstractive summarization must consider an additional constraint that a generated summary should not exceed a desired length. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective extension of a sinusoidal positional encoding (Vaswani et al., 2017) so that a neural encoder-decoder model preserves the length constraint. Unlike previous studies that learn length embeddings, the proposed method can generate a text of any length even if the target length is unseen in training data. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able not only to control generation length but also improve ROUGE scores.",Positional Encoding to Control Output Sequence Length,A Simple but Effective Extension of a sinusoidal positional encoding for Abstractive Summarization,A Simple and Effective Extension of Neural Encoder-Decoder Models for Abstractive Summarization Using a Sinusoidal Position,Learning Length Embeddings for Abstractive Summarization with Neural Encoder-Decoder Models,Sinusoidal Positional Encoding for Neural Language Generation, A Sinusoidal Neural Encoder-Decoder Model for Abstractive Summarization,

We start by giving a closed form solution for the definition of the optimal weights of a linear autoencoder given a training set of sequences. This solution, however, is computationally very demanding, so we suggest a procedure to get an approximate solution for a given number of hidden units. The weights obtained for the linear autoencoder are then used as initial weights for the inputto-hidden connections of a recurrent neural network, which is then trained on the desired task. Using four well known datasets of sequences of polyphonic music, we show that the proposed pre-training approach is highly effective, since it allows to largely improve the state of the art results on all the considered datasets.",Pre-training of Recurrent Neural Networks via Linear Autoencoders,Pre-training for Recurrent Neural Networks with Linear Autoencoder Networks,,Pre-training of Linear Autoencoder Networks for Recurrent Neural Networks,Pre-training for Recurrent Neural Networks with Linear Autoencoder Networks, Training Recurrent Neural Networks with Linear Autoencoders,Pre-training of Linear Autoencoder Networks for Sequences

Cross-language sentiment classification (CLSC) can leverage the rich resources in one language (source language) for sentiment classification in a resource-scarce language (target language). Bilingual embeddings could eliminate the semantic gap between two languages for CLSC, but ignore the sentiment information of text. This paper proposes an approach to learning bilingual sentiment word embeddings (BSWE) for English-Chinese CLSC. The proposed BSWE incorporate sentiment information of text into bilingual embeddings. Furthermore, we can learn high-quality BSWE by simply employing labeled corpora and their translations, without relying on largescale parallel corpora.

The algorithm is of heuristic nature and it uses as unique evidence for clustering the identification of cognate named entities between both sides of the comparable corpora. One of the main advantages of this approach is that it does not depend on bilingual or multilingual resources. However, it depends on the possibility of identifying cognate named entities between the languages used in the corpus. An additional advantage of the approach is that it does not need any information about the right number of clusters; the algorithm calculates it. We have tested this approach with a comparable corpus of news written in English and Spanish. In addition, we have compared the results with a system which translates selected document features. The obtained results are encouraging.",Multilingual Document Clustering: An Heuristic Approach Based on Cognate Named Entities,Multilingual Document Clustering in Comparable Corpora Using Heuristic Data,Multilingual Document Clustering in Comparable Corpora: Identifying Cognate Named Entities by Means of Heuristic Information,Multilingual Document Clustering in Comparable Corpora using Cognate Named Entities,Multilingual Document Clustering in Comparable Corpora, Multilingual Document Clustering Using Comparable Corpora,

Many techniques such as data augmentation and novel regularizers such as Dropout have been proposed to prevent overfitting without requiring a massive amount of training data. In this work, we propose a new regularizer called DeCov which leads to significantly reduced overfitting (as indicated by the difference between train and val performance), and better generalization. Our regularizer encourages diverse or non-redundant representations in Deep Neural Networks by minimizing the cross-covariance of hidden activations. This simple intuition has been explored in a number of past works but surprisingly has never been applied as a regularizer in supervised learning. Experiments across a range of datasets and network architectures show that this loss always reduces overfitting while almost always maintaining or increasing generalization performance and often improving performance over Dropout.",Reducing Overfitting in Deep Networks by Decorrelating Representations,DeCov: Reducing Overfitting in Deep Neural Networks by Minimizing Cross-Covariance,DeCov: DeCov Regularized Training of Deep Neural Networks via Cross-Covariance and Generalization.,DeCov: A Cross-Covariance Regularizer for Deep Neural Networks,DeCov: Regularizing Deep Neural Networks for Overfitting, DeCov: DeCov Regularization for Deep Neural Networks,

93,"Information-theoretic measures are among the most standard techniques for evaluation of clustering methods including word sense induction (WSI) systems. Such measures rely on sample-based estimates of the entropy. However, the standard maximum likelihood estimates of the entropy are heavily biased with the bias dependent on, among other things, the number of clusters and the sample size. This makes the measures unreliable and unfair when the number of clusters produced by different systems vary and the sample size is not exceedingly large. This corresponds exactly to the setting of WSI evaluation where a ground-truth cluster sense number arguably does not exist and the standard evaluation scenarios use a small number of instances of each word to compute the score. We describe more accurate entropy estimators and analyze their performance both in simulations and on evaluation of WSI systems.",Improved Estimation of Entropy for Evaluation of Word Sense Induction,Evaluating Word Sense Induction Systems Using Entropy Estimation,Evaluation of Word Sense Induction Using Entropy Estimation Measures and the Sample Size of Clustering Schemes,Evaluation of Word Sense Induction Systems Based on Sample-Based Entropy Estimation,, Evaluating Clustering Methods Using Word Sense Induction,On the Accuracy of Entropy Estimation for Word Sense Induction

Yet there is evidence that differences between annotators are not always random attention slips but could result from different biases towards the classification categories, at least for the harder-to-decide cases.

However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality.",Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation,An Unsupervised Method for Domain Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translation,Unsupervised SMT Induction of Phrase-Based Translation Models from Monolingual Corpora with Application to Domain Adaptation,Unsupervised Unfolding of Phrase-based Translation Model for Domain Adaptation,Inducing a Simple Word-Based Translation Model from the Monolingual Corpora, Unsupervised Phrase-Based Translation Model for Domain Adaptation,

In order for the relationships between the game elements to be natural, common-sense has to be encoded into arrangement of the elements. In this work, we investigate a machine learning approach for world creation using content from the multiplayer text adventure game environment LIGHT (Urbanek et al. 2019). We introduce neural network based models to compositionally arrange locations, characters, and objects into a coherent whole. In addition to creating worlds based on existing elements, our models can generate new game content. Humans can also leverage our models to interactively aid in worldbuilding. We show that the game environments created with our approach are cohesive, diverse, and preferred by human evaluators compared to other machine learning based world construction algorithms.",Generating Interactive Worlds with Text,Learning to Generate Cohesive and Efficient Games using Content from Online Games,Learning to Generate Cohesive Games Using Neural Network-based Content from the Online World-Building Task in Multi-player Text,,Machine Learning for World Creation using Multiplayer Text Adventure Game Environments, Cohesive and Interesting World Creation Using Neural Networks,Multiplayer Text Adventure Games with Compositional Neural Networks

Unfortunately, they are also very brittle and easily falter when presented with noisy data. In this paper, we confront NMT models with synthetic and natural sources of noise. We find that state-of-the-art models fail to translate even moderately noisy texts that humans have no trouble comprehending. We explore two approaches to increase model robustness: structure-invariant word representations and robust training on noisy texts.

When training with Dropout, a randomly selected subset of activations are set to zero within each layer. DropConnect instead sets a randomly selected subset of weights within the network to zero. Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect. We then evaluate DropConnect on a range of datasets, comparing to Dropout, and show state-of-the-art results on several image recognition benchmarks by aggregating multiple DropConnect-trained models.",Regularization of Neural Networks using DropConnect,DropConnect: A Generalization of Dropout for Regularizing Neural Networks,DropConnect: Regularizing Fully-Connected Networks via Randomized Subset Selection and Multiple Drop-Connecting Data Aggregation,DropConnect: A Generalization of Dropout for Fully-Connected Neural Networks,DropConnect: A Generalization of Dropout in Neural Networks,,Dropout Meets DropConnect: Regularizing Fully-Connected Neural Networks

Given labeled data annotated with frame-semantic parses, we learn a model that projects the set of word representations for the syntactic context around a predicate to a low dimensional representation. The latter is used for semantic frame identification; with a standard argument identification method inspired by prior work, we achieve state-ofthe-art results on FrameNet-style framesemantic analysis.

Given a collection of trained models, we measure the similarity of their internal representations and attention. Critically, these models come from vastly different architectures. We use existing and novel similarity measures that aim to gauge the level of localization of information in the deep models, and facilitate the investigation of which design factors affect model similarity, without requiring any external linguistic annotation. The analysis reveals that models within the same family are more similar to one another, as may be expected. Surprisingly, different architectures have rather similar representations, but different individual neurons. We also observed differences in information localization in lower and higher layers and found that higher layers are more affected by fine-tuning on downstream tasks.",Similarity Analysis of Contextual Word Representation Models,,Similarity Analysis of Contextual Word Representations: A Case Study on Information Localization in the Lens of Similarity Analysis.,Similarity Analysis of Contextual Word Representations in Deep Learning,Similarity Measures for Contextual Word Representations, Contextual Word Representation Models,Comparing Neural Architectures of Contextual Word Representations

114,"Recently, work in NLP was initiated on a type of opinion inference that arises when opinions are expressed toward events which have positive or negative effects on entities (+/-effect events). This paper addresses methods for creating a lexicon of such events, to support such work on opinion inference. Due to significant sense ambiguity, our goal is to develop a sense-level rather than word-level lexicon. To maximize the effectiveness of different types of information, we combine a graph-based method using WordNet1 relations and a standard classifier using gloss information. A hybrid between the two gives the best results. Further, we provide evidence that the model is an effective way to guide manual annotation to find +/-effect senses that are not in the seed set.",+/-EffectWordNet: Sense-level Lexicon Acquisition for Opinion Inference,A Sense-Level Lexicon for Opinion Inference in NLP,A Sense-Level Lexicon of Events Using WordNet1 Relations and Gloss Information for Opinion Inference on Entities +/-,A Graph-based Lexicon of +/--Effect Events,, A Sense-Level Lexicon for Opinion Inference,A Sense-Level Lexicon for Opinion Inference

In this paper, we scale up the integration of SWSD into contextual opinion analysis and still obtain improvements in performance, by successfully gathering data annotated by non-expert annotators. Further, by improving the method for integrating SWSD into contextual opinion analysis, even greater benefits from SWSD are achieved than in previous work.

Prior zero-shot slot filling models use slot descriptions to learn concepts, but are not robust to misaligned schemas.

Thus a major challenge is to find an algorithm which achieves better label complexity, is consistent in an agnostic setting, and applies to general classification problems.

In this paper, we propose a simple technique to improve a generalization ability of deep RL agents by introducing a randomized (convolutional) neural network that randomly perturbs input observations. It enables trained agents to adapt to new domains by learning robust features invariant across varied and randomized environments. Furthermore, we consider an inference method based on the Monte Carlo approximation to reduce the variance induced by this randomization.

However, the brittleness of existing neural net approaches is revealed by notable failures, such as the existence of adversarial examples that are misclassified despite being nearly identical to a training example, or the inability of recurrent sequence-processing nets to stay on track without teacher forcing. We introduce a method, which we refer to as state reification, that involves modeling the distribution of hidden states over the training data and then projecting hidden states observed during testing toward this distribution. Our intuition is that if the network can remain in a familiar manifold of hidden space, subsequent layers of the net should be well trained to respond appropriately. We show that this state-reification method helps neural nets to generalize better, especially when labeled data are sparse, and also helps overcome the challenge of achieving robust generalization with adversarial training.",State-Reification Networks: Improving Generalization by Modeling the Distribution of Hidden Representations,State Reification for Robust Generalization in Neural Networks,State Reification for Robust Neural Net Generalization with Adversarial Training of Finite-Labeled Data via Hidden State,,State Reification for Neural Nets to Generalize, State Reification for Neural Networks,State Reification for Robust Neural Nets

We implement and test four quantitative theories, all of which are theoretically motivated in terms of efficiency in human language production and comprehension. The four theories we test are subjectivity (Scontras et al., 2017), information locality (Futrell, 2019), integration cost (Dyer, 2017), and information gain, which we introduce. We evaluate theories based on their ability to predict orders of unseen adjectives in hand-parsed and automatically-parsed dependency treebanks. We find that subjectivity, information locality, and information gain are all strong predictors, with some evidence for a two-factor account, where subjectivity and information gain reflect a factor involving semantics, and information locality reflects collocational preferences.",What determines the order of adjectives in English?

A setting of particular interest is when the clients are mobile devices, where two important concerns are communication efficiency and the privacy of the clients. Several recent works have focused on reducing the communication cost or introducing privacy guarantees, but none of the proposed communication efficient methods are known to be privacy preserving and none of the known privacy mechanisms are known to be communication efficient. To this end, we study algorithms that achieve both communication efficiency and differential privacy. For d variables and n ⇡ d clients, the proposed method uses O(log log(nd)) bits of communication per client per coordinate and ensures constant privacy.

143,"Distant-supervised relation extraction inevitably suffers from wrong labeling problems because it heuristically labels relational facts with knowledge bases. Previous sentence level denoise models don't achieve satisfying performances because they use hard labels which are determined by distant supervision and immutable during training. To this end, we introduce an entity-pair level denoise method which exploits semantic information from correctly labeled entity pairs to correct wrong labels dynamically during training. We propose a joint score function which combines the relational scores based on the entity-pair representation and the confidence of the hard label to obtain a new label, namely a soft label, for certain entity pair. During training, soft labels instead of hard labels serve as gold labels. Experiments on the benchmark dataset show that our method dramatically reduces noisy instances and outperforms other state-of-the-art systems.",A Soft-label Method for Noise-tolerant Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction,Entity-Pair Level Denoise for Distant-Supervised Relation Extraction,Entity-Pair Level Denoise for Distant-Supervised Relation Extraction with Soft Label Combination and Joint Score Function,,Entity-Pair Level Denoise for Distant-Supervised Relation Extraction,Entity-pair Level Denoising for Relation Extraction,Entity-Pair Level Denoise for Distant Relation Extraction
144,"We show that it is feasible to perform entity linking by training a dual encoder (two-tower) model that encodes mentions and entities in the same dense vector space, where candidate entities are retrieved by approximate nearest neighbor search. Unlike prior work, this setup does not rely on an alias table followed by a re-ranker, and is thus the first fully learned entity retrieval model. We show that our dual encoder, trained using only anchor-text links in Wikipedia, outperforms discrete alias table and BM25 baselines, and is competitive with the best comparable results on the standard TACKBP-2010 dataset. In addition, it can retrieve candidates extremely fast, and generalizes well to a new dataset derived from Wikinews.

Some prior research finds no gain over and above what is obtained with ngram features—arguably the most widely used features in text classification. Here, we experiment with two very different emotion lexicons and show that even in supervised settings, an affect lexicon can provide significant gains. We further show that while ngram features tend to be accurate, they are often unsuitable for use in new domains. On the other hand, affect lexicon features tend to generalize and produce better results than ngrams when applied to a new domain.",Portable Features for Classifying Emotional Text,Are Affect Lexicons Useful for Sentence Level Emotion Detection?,Are Word-Level Affect Lexicons Useful in Detecting Emotional Sentences at Sentence Level?

147,"Many natural language processing applications use language models to generate text. These models are typically trained to predict the next word in a sequence, given the previous words and some context such as an image. However, at test time the model is expected to generate the entire sequence from scratch. This discrepancy makes generation brittle, as errors may accumulate along the way. We address this issue by proposing a novel sequence level training algorithm that directly optimizes the metric used at test time, such as BLEU or ROUGE. On three different tasks, our approach outperforms several strong baselines for greedy generation. The method is also competitive when these baselines employ beam search, while being several times faster.",Sequence Level Training with Recurrent Neural Networks,Sequence Level Training for Greedy Generation of Text,Towards a Sequence Level Training Algorithm for Greedy Generation of Natural Language Texts using Beam Search and BLEU,A Sequence Level Training Algorithm for Greedy Text Generation,,Sequence Level Training for Natural Language Generation,Sequence Level Training for Generative Adversarial Learning

A major assumption for this paradigm is that all those tasks are indeed related so that the joint training is appropriate and beneficial. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-task learning of shared feature representations among tasks, while simultaneously determining “with whom” each task should share. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer programming and provide an alternating minimization technique to solve the optimization problem of jointly identifying grouping structures and parameters. The algorithm monotonically decreases the objective function and converges to a local optimum. Compared to the standard MTL paradigm where all tasks are in a single group, our algorithm improves its performance with statistical significance for three out of the four datasets we have studied. We also demonstrate its advantage over other task grouping techniques investigated in literature.",Learning with Whom to Share in Multi-task Feature Learning.,Multi-Task Learning of Shared Feature Representations with Alternating Minimization,Multi-task Learning of Shared Feature Representations among Tasks: A Mixed Integer Programming Algorithm and Alternating Minimization,Mixed Integer Programming for Joint Multi-Task Learning of Shared Feature Representations,Joint Multi-Task Learning of Shared Feature Representations,Multi-Task Learning of Shared Feature Representations,

In this paper, we propose that transition-based model is more appropriate for parsing the naked discourse tree (i.e., identifying span and nuclearity) due to data sparsity. At the same time, we argue that relation labeling can benefit from naked tree structure and should be treated elaborately with consideration of three kinds of relations including within-sentence, across-sentence and across-paragraph relations. Thus, we design a pipelined two-stage parsing method for generating an RST tree from text.

However, the categorial formalism for which this equivalence has been established differs significantly from the versions of CCG that are in use today. In particular, it allows restriction of combinatory rules on a per grammar basis, whereas modern CCG assumes a universal set of rules, isolating all cross-linguistic variation in the lexicon.

Each variable-length text is represented by several independent feature vectors; one word vector per sentence or paragraph. For learning from texts with known aspect ratings, the model performs multipleinstance regression (MIR) and assigns importance weights to each of the sentences or paragraphs of a text, uncovering their contribution to the aspect ratings. Next, the model is used to predict aspect ratings in previously unseen texts, demonstrating interpretability and explanatory power for its predictions. We evaluate the model on seven multi-aspect sentiment analysis data sets, improving over four MIR baselines and two strong bag-of-words linear models, namely SVR and Lasso, by more than 10% relative in terms of MSE.",Explaining the Stars: Weighted Multiple-Instance Learning for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,MultipleInstance Learning for Aspect Rating Prediction from Texts with Known Aspects,MultipleInstance Regression for Aspect Ratings and Their Impact on Sentiment Analysis from Texts with Weercontributed Multiple-,Multiple-Instance Learning for Predicting Aspect Ratings from Texts,,Multiple Instance Regression for Aspect Rating Prediction,MultipleInstance Learning for Predicting Aspect Ratings from User-contributed Texts
163,"We present a simple approach for text infilling, the task of predicting missing spans of text at any position in a document. While infilling could enable rich functionality especially for writing assistance tools, more attention has been devoted to language modeling-a special case of infilling where text is predicted at the end of a document. In this paper, we aim to extend the capabilities of language models (LMs) to the more general task of infilling. To this end, we train (or fine tune) off-the-shelf LMs on sequences containing the concatenation of artificially-masked text and the text which was masked. We show that this approach, which we call infilling by language modeling, can enable LMs to infill entire sentences effectively on three different domains: short stories, scientific abstracts, and lyrics. Furthermore, we show that humans have difficulty identifying sentences infilled by our approach as machine-generated in the domain of short stories.",Enabling Language Models to Fill in the Blanks,Text Infilling by Language Modeling,,"Text Infilling by Language Modeling: A Case Study on Short Stories, Scientific Abstracts, and Lyrics",Language Modeling for Infilling Texts,Text Infilling with Language Modeling,Text Infilling by Language Modeling

For the encoder of our model, we encode the input sequence into context representations using BERT. For the decoder, there are two stages in our model, in the first stage, we use a Transformer-based decoder to generate a draft output sequence. In the second stage, we mask each word of the draft sequence and feed it to BERT, then by combining the input sequence and the draft representation generated by BERT, we use a Transformer-based decoder to predict the refined word for each masked position. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first method which applies the BERT into text generation tasks. As the first step in this direction, we evaluate our proposed method on the text summarization task.

177,"Text-based games present a unique challenge for autonomous agents to operate in natural language and handle enormous action spaces. In this paper, we propose the Contextual Action Language Model (CALM) to generate a compact set of action candidates at each game state. Our key insight is to train language models on human gameplay, where people demonstrate linguistic priors and a general game sense for promising actions conditioned on game history. We combine CALM with a reinforcement learning agent which re-ranks the generated action candidates to maximize in-game rewards. We evaluate our approach using the Jericho benchmark, on games unseen by CALM during training.

178,"Spectral clustering is one of the most popular clustering approaches. Despite its good performance, it is limited in its applicability to large-scale problems due to its high computational complexity. Recently, many approaches have been proposed to accelerate the spectral clustering. Unfortunately, these methods usually sacrifice quite a lot information of the original data, thus result in a degradation of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Landmark-based Spectral Clustering (LSC), for large scale clustering problems. Specifically, we select p ( n) representative data points as the landmarks and represent the original data points as the linear combinations of these landmarks. The spectral embedding of the data can then be efficiently computed with the landmark-based representation. The proposed algorithm scales linearly with the problem size. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach comparing to the state-of-the-art methods.",Large Scale Spectral Clustering with Landmark-Based Representation,Landmark-based Spectral Clustering for Large Scale Problems,Landmark-based Spectral Clustering: Landmark-Based Representation and Algorithm for Large-Scale Clust,Landmark-based Spectral Clustering for Large-Scale Problem Resolution,Landmark-based Spectral Clustering for Large Scale Clustering,Landmark-based Spectral Clustering for Large Scale Clustering,
179,We develop a scalable deep non-parametric generative model by augmenting deep Gaussian processes with a recognition model. Inference is performed in a novel scalable variational framework where the variational posterior distributions are reparametrized through a multilayer perceptron. The key aspect of this reformulation is that it prevents the proliferation of variational parameters which otherwise grow linearly in proportion to the sample size. We derive a new formulation of the variational lower bound that allows us to distribute most of the computation in a way that enables to handle datasets of the size of mainstream deep learning tasks. We show the efficacy of the method on a variety of challenges including deep unsupervised learning and deep Bayesian optimization.,Variational Auto-encoded Deep Gaussian Processes,,A Scalable Variational Model for Deep Gaussian Processes with a Multilayer Perceptron Reparametrized,Scalable Deep Non-parametric Generative Models via Multilayer Perceptron Reparametrizing,Scalable Deep Non-parametric Generative Models,Deep Nonparametric Generative Models,Scaling Non-Parametric Generative Models
180,Most of the current automated essay scoring (AES) systems are trained using manually graded essays from a specific prompt. These systems experience a drop in accuracy when used to grade an essay from a different prompt. Obtaining a large number of manually graded essays each time a new prompt is introduced is costly and not viable. We propose domain adaptation as a solution to adapt an AES system from an initial prompt to a new prompt. We also propose a novel domain adaptation technique that uses Bayesian linear ridge regression. We evaluate our domain adaptation technique on the publicly available Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP) dataset and show that our proposed technique is a competitive default domain adaptation algorithm for the AES task.,Flexible Domain Adaptation for Automated Essay Scoring Using Correlated Linear Regression,Domain Adaptation for Automated Essay Scoring,Domain Adaptation for Automated Essay Scoring Using Bayesian Linear-Ridge Regression using Domain Adaptation and Domain,Domain Adaptation for Automated Essay Scoring,Domain Adaptation for Automated Essay Scoring,Domain Adaptation for Automatic Essay Scoring,

The core idea is to directly intervene in the discussion with textual responses that are meant to counter the hate content and prevent it from further spreading. Accordingly, automation strategies, such as natural language generation, are beginning to be investigated. Still, they suffer from the lack of sufficient amount of quality data and tend to produce generic/repetitive responses. Being aware of the aforementioned limitations, we present a study on how to collect responses to hate effectively, employing large scale unsupervised language models such as GPT-2 for the generation of silver data, and the best annotation strategies/neural architectures that can be used for data filtering before expert validation/post-editing.",Generating Counter Narratives against Online Hate Speech: Data and Strategies,Collecting Responses to Hate with Unsupervised Language Models,Automation Strategies to Collect Responses to Hate in Online Discussions: An Empirical Study of the Role of Content Moder,Collecting Responses to Hate: A Case Study on Unsupervised Generation of Textual Response to Hateful Content,Using Textual Responses to Hass in Online Discussion,,Collecting Responses to Hate on Social Media

While specialized models have been developed for particular applications, few are widely used in practice, as customization typically requires derivation of a custom inference algorithm. In this paper, we build on recent advances in variational inference methods and propose a general neural framework, based on topic models, to enable flexible incorporation of metadata and allow for rapid exploration of alternative models. Our approach achieves strong performance, with a manageable tradeoff between perplexity, coherence, and sparsity.

Compared with Transformers, topic models are better at learning explicit document semantics, and hence could be integrated into Transformers to further boost their performance. To this end, we rearrange and explore the semantics learned by a topic model, and then propose a topic assistant (TA) including three modules. TA is compatible with various Transformer-based models and user-friendly since i) TA is a plug-and-play model that does not break any structure of the original Transformer network, making users easily fine-tune Transformer+TA based on a well pre-trained model; ii) TA only introduces a small number of extra parameters.

190,"As a crucial step in extractive document summarization, learning cross-sentence relations has been explored by a plethora of approaches. An intuitive way is to put them in the graph-based neural network, which has a more complex structure for capturing inter-sentence relationships. In this paper, we present a heterogeneous graph-based neural network for extractive summarization (HETERSUMGRAPH), which contains semantic nodes of different granularity levels apart from sentences. These additional nodes act as the intermediary between sentences and enrich the cross-sentence relations. Besides, our graph structure is flexible in natural extension from a single-document setting to multi-document via introducing document nodes. To our knowledge, we are the first one to introduce different types of nodes into graph-based neural networks for extractive document summarization and perform a comprehensive qualitative analysis to investigate their benefits.

192,"In contrast to the standard classification paradigm where the true class is given to each training pattern, complementary-label learning only uses training patterns each equipped with a complementary label, which only specifies one of the classes that the pattern does not belong to. The goal of this paper is to derive a novel framework of complementary-label learning with an unbiased estimator of the classification risk, for arbitrary losses and models—all existing methods have failed to achieve this goal. Not only is this beneficial for the learning stage, it also makes model/hyper-parameter selection (through crossvalidation) possible without the need of any ordinarily labeled validation data, while using any linear/non-linear models or convex/non-convex loss functions. We further improve the risk estimator by a non-negative correction and gradient ascent trick, and demonstrate its superiority through experiments.",Complementary-Label Learning for Arbitrary Losses and Models,Non-negative Correction and Gradient Ascent for Non-negative Classification,Combining Training and Cross-Validation with Unbiased Estimation of the Classification Risk: A Case Study on Complementary,An Unbiased Risk Estimation for Complementary-Label Learning,Comparative-Label Learning with a Non-negative Correction and Gradient Ascent,,Cross-validation of complementary-label learning with an unbiased risk estimator

In this paper, we investigate crosslingual transfer and posit that an orderagnostic model will perform better when transferring to distant foreign languages. To test our hypothesis, we train dependency parsers on an English corpus and evaluate their transfer performance on 30 other languages. Specifically, we compare encoders and decoders based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and modified self-attentive architectures. The former relies on sequential information while the latter is more flexible at modeling word order. Rigorous experiments and detailed analysis shows that RNN-based architectures transfer well to languages that are close to English, while self-attentive models have better overall cross-lingual transferability and perform especially well on distant languages.",On Difficulties of Cross-Lingual Transfer with Order Differences: A Case Study on Dependency Parsing,Cross-Lingual Transfer and Self-Attentive Models,Cross-Lingual Transfer of Order-Agnostic Dependency Parsers with Recurrent Neural Networks and Modified Self-,Cross-Lingual Transferability of Dependency Parsers with Self-Attentive and RNNs,,Cross-Lingual Transfer and Perturbation of Dependency Parsers,Dependency-Based Cross-Lingual Transfer: An Order Agnostic Approach

To realize our goal, we focus on expressions associated with time-slot (time-associated words). However, listing up all the time-associated words is impractical, because there are numerous time-associated expressions. We therefore use a semi-supervised learning method, the Naïve Bayes classifier backed up with the Expectation Maximization algorithm, in order to iteratively extract time-associated words while improving the classifier.

At the same time, it also corrects, in a timely fashion, the mistakes in the former overgenerated words when observing more source context to ensure high translation quality.

In this work, we propose SCAN, a Spatial Context Attentive Network that can jointly predict socially-acceptable multiple future trajectories for all pedestrians in a scene. SCAN encodes the influence of spatially close neighbors using a novel spatial attention mechanism in a manner that relies on fewer assumptions, is parameter efficient, and is more interpretable compared to state-of-the-art spatial attention approaches. Through experiments on several datasets we demonstrate that our approach can also quantitatively outperform state of the art trajectory prediction methods in terms of accuracy of predicted intent.",SCAN: A Spatial Context Attentive Network for Joint Multi-Agent Intent Prediction,SCAN: A Spatial Context Attentive Network for Predicting Pedestrian Intent,SCAN: Spatial Context Attentive Networks for Pedestrian Motion Prediction using Spatial Attention in Human Centric En,SCAN: A Spatial Context Attentive Network for Predicting Pedestrian Intent,,SCAN: Spatial Context Attentive Networks for Predicting Multiple Future Trajectories,SCAN: Spatial Context Attentive Networks for Predicting Pedestrian Intent
213,"Distant supervision, heuristically labeling a corpus using a knowledge base, has emerged as a popular choice for training relation extractors. In this paper, we show that a significant number of “negative“ examples generated by the labeling process are false negatives because the knowledge base is incomplete. Therefore the heuristic for generating negative examples has a serious flaw. Building on a state-of-the-art distantly-supervised extraction algorithm, we proposed an algorithm that learns from only positive and unlabeled labels at the pair-of-entity level. Experimental results demonstrate its advantage over existing algorithms.",Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction with an Incomplete Knowledge Base,Learning from Only Positive and Unlabeled Labels for Distant Supervision,,Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Labels for Distantly-Supervised Relation Extraction,Distant Supervision: Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Labels,Negative Examples in Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction,Learning from Only Positive and Unlabeled Labels in Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction
214,"Online shopping caters the needs of millions of users on a daily basis. To build an accurate system that can retrieve relevant products for a query like “MB252 with travel bags” one requires product and query categorization mechanisms, which classify the text as Home&Garden>Kitchen&Dining>Kitchen Appliances>Blenders. One of the biggest challenges in e-Commerce is that providers like Amazon, e-Bay, Google, Yahoo! and Walmart organize products into different product taxonomies making it hard and time-consuming for sellers to categorize goods for each shopping platform. To address this challenge, we propose an automatic product categorization mechanism, which for a given product title assigns the correct product category from a taxonomy. We conducted an empirical evaluation on 445, 408 product titles and used a rich product taxonomy of 319 categories organized into 6 levels. We compared performance against multiple algorithms and found that the best performing system reaches .88 f-score.",Everyone Likes Shopping!

215,"We introduce a novel coreference resolution system that models entities and events jointly. Our iterative method cautiously constructs clusters of entity and event mentions using linear regression to model cluster merge operations. As clusters are built, information flows between entity and event clusters through features that model semantic role dependencies. Our system handles nominal and verbal events as well as entities, and our joint formulation allows information from event coreference to help entity coreference, and vice versa. In a cross-document domain with comparable documents, joint coreference resolution performs significantly better (over 3 CoNLL F1 points) than two strong baselines that resolve entities and events separately.",Joint Entity and Event Coreference Resolution across Documents,Joint Coreference Resolution with Entity and Event Mention Clusters,Joint Coreference Resolution of Entities and Events Using Modeling Semantic Role Dependencies using Linear Regression and Iterative,Joint Entity and Event Coreference Resolution with Semantic Role Dependencies,Joint Coreference Resolution for Entity and Events,Joint Entity and Event Coreference Resolution,
216,"Increasing model size when pretraining natural language representations often results in improved performance on downstream tasks. However, at some point further model increases become harder due to GPU/TPU memory limitations and longer training times. To address these problems, we present two parameterreduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a self-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks with multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and SQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.

217,"With the great success of pre-trained language models, the pretrain-finetune paradigm now becomes the undoubtedly dominant solution for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. At the fine-tune stage, target task data is usually introduced in a completely random order and treated equally. However, examples in NLU tasks can vary greatly in difficulty, and similar to human learning procedure, language models can benefit from an easy-to-difficult curriculum. Based on this idea, we propose our Curriculum Learning approach. By reviewing the trainset in a crossed way, we are able to distinguish easy examples from difficult ones, and arrange a curriculum for language models. Without any manual model architecture design or use of external data, our Curriculum Learning approach obtains significant and universal performance improvements on a wide range of NLU tasks.",Curriculum Learning for Natural Language Understanding,Curriculum Learning for Language Models with Difficulty,,Curriculum Learning for Natural Language Understanding: An Easy-to-Difficult Approach,Pretrain-Finetune Curriculum for Natural Language Understanding,Curriculum Learning for Natural Language Understanding,Curriculum Learning for Pre-trained Language Models
218,"We introduce the Adaptive Skills, Adaptive Partitions (ASAP) framework that (1) learns skills (i.e., temporally extended actions or options) as well as (2) where to apply them. We believe that both (1) and (2) are necessary for a truly general skill learning framework, which is a key building block needed to scale up to lifelong learning agents. The ASAP framework can also solve related new tasks simply by adapting where it applies its existing learned skills. We prove that ASAP converges to a local optimum under natural conditions. Finally, our experimental results, which include a RoboCup domain, demonstrate the ability of ASAP to learn where to reuse skills as well as solve multiple tasks with considerably less experience than solving each task from scratch.",Higher-Order Correlation Clustering for Image Segmentation,"Adaptive Skills, Adaptive Partitions: An Application to Lifelong Learning","Adaptive Skills, Adaptive Partitions and Where to Go From There: A Case Study on Lifelong Learning with Application to",,"The Adaptive Skills, Adaptive Partitions Framework","Adaptive Skills, Adaptive Partitions","Adaptive Skills, Adaptive Partitions: A General Skill Learning Framework"

Our framework leverages recent breakthroughs in cross-lingual pretrained language modeling resulting in highly multilingual and adaptable MT evaluation models that exploit information from both the source input and a target-language reference translation in order to more accurately predict MT quality. To showcase our framework, we train three models with different types of human judgements: Direct Assessments, Human-mediated Translation Edit Rate and Multidimensional Quality Metric.

220,"In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised learning approach to automatically discover, summarize, and manipulate artistic styles from large collections of paintings. Our method is based on archetypal analysis, which is an unsupervised learning technique akin to sparse coding with a geometric interpretation. When applied to neural style representations from a collection of artworks, it learns a dictionary of archetypal styles, which can be easily visualized. After training the model, the style of a new image, which is characterized by local statistics of deep visual features, is approximated by a sparse convex combination of archetypes. This enables us to interpret which archetypal styles are present in the input image, and in which proportion. Finally, our approach allows us to manipulate the coefficients of the latent archetypal decomposition, and achieve various special effects such as style enhancement, transfer, and interpolation between multiple archetypes.",Unsupervised Learning of Artistic Styles with Archetypal Style Analysis,,"Unsupervised Style Discovery, Summarization, and Manipulation from Large Collections of Artworks using Archetypal Analysis.",Unsupervised Style Discovery from Large Artworks via Archetypal Analysis,Unsupervised Learning of Artistic Styles from Paintings,Learning Archetypal Style Representations from Artworks,Unsupervised Discovery and Manipulation of Artistic Styles from Artworks
221,"In this paper we address the problem of learning multimodal word representations by integrating textual, visual and auditory inputs. Inspired by the re-constructive and associative nature of human memory, we propose a novel associative multichannel autoencoder (AMA). Our model first learns the associations between textual and perceptual modalities, so as to predict the missing perceptual information of concepts. Then the textual and predicted perceptual representations are fused through reconstructing their original and associated embeddings. Using a gating mechanism our model assigns different weights to each modality according to the different concepts. Results on six benchmark concept similarity tests show that the proposed method significantly outperforms strong unimodal baselines and state-of-the-art multimodal models.",Associative Multichannel Autoencoder for Multimodal Word Representation,,Associative Multichannel Autoencoder for Learning Multimodal Word Representations with Attribute Recurrent Neural,Learning Multimodal Word Representations with Associative Multichannel Autoencoders,"Learning Multimodal Word Representations by Integrating Textual, Visual and Auditive Input",Learning Multimodal Word Representations with Associative Multichannel Autoencoders,Associative Multimodal Autoencoder for Concept Similarity
222,"When training multilingual machine translation (MT) models that can translate to/from multiple languages, we are faced with imbalanced training sets: some languages have much more training data than others. Standard practice is to up-sample less resourced languages to increase representation, and the degree of up-sampling has a large effect on the overall performance. In this paper, we propose a method that instead automatically learns how to weight training data through a data scorer that is optimized to maximize performance on all test languages. Experiments on two sets of languages under both one-to-many and many-to-one MT settings show our method not only consistently outperforms heuristic baselines in terms of average performance, but also offers flexible control over the performance of which languages are optimized.",Balancing Training for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,Learning to Weight Training Data for Multilingual Machine Translation,,Learning to Optimize Training Data for Multilingual Machine Translation,Learning to Weight Multilingual Machine Translation with Data Scorers,Learning to Weight Training Data for Multilingual Machine Translation,Automatically Learning to Weight Training Data for Multi-lingual Machine Translation
223,"A major engineering challenge in statistical machine translation systems is the efficient representation of extremely large translation rulesets. In phrase-based models, this problem can be addressed by storing the training data in memory and using a suffix array as an efficient index to quickly lookup and extract rules on the fly. Hierarchical phrasebased translation introduces the added wrinkle of source phrases with gaps. Lookup algorithms used for contiguous phrases no longer apply and the best approximate pattern matching algorithms are much too slow, taking several minutes per sentence. We describe new lookup algorithms for hierarchical phrase-based translation that reduce the empirical computation time by nearly two orders of magnitude, making on-the-fly lookup feasible for source phrases with gaps.",Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation with Suffix Arrays,Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation via On-the-fly lookup,Lookup Algorithms for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation with Gaps: An Efficient Lookup Algorithm,Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation with Gaps: Faster Lookup Algorithms,,Lookup Algorithms for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation,Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation with Gap Indexing
224,"We present a hybrid approach to sentence simplification which combines deep semantics and monolingual machine translation to derive simple sentences from complex ones. The approach differs from previous work in two main ways. First, it is semantic based in that it takes as input a deep semantic representation rather than e.g., a sentence or a parse tree. Second, it combines a simplification model for splitting and deletion with a monolingual translation model for phrase substitution and reordering. When compared against current state of the art methods, our model yields significantly simpler output that is both grammatical and meaning preserving.",Hybrid Simplification using Deep Semantics and Machine Translation,A Hybrid Approach to Sentence Simplification with Deep Semantics and Monolingual Translation,A Hybrid Approach to Simple Sentence Simplification with Deep Semantic and Monolingual Translation Model for Phrase Substitution and,A Hybrid Approach to Sentence Simplification Using Deep Semantics and Monolingual Machine Translation,,A Hybrid Approach to Sentence Simplification,A Hybrid Approach to Sentence Simplification with Deep Semantics and Monolingual Translation
225,"Previous work using topic model for statistical machine translation (SMT) explore topic information at the word level. However, SMT has been advanced from word-based paradigm to phrase/rule-based paradigm. We therefore propose a topic similarity model to exploit topic information at the synchronous rule level for hierarchical phrase-based translation. We associate each synchronous rule with a topic distribution, and select desirable rules according to the similarity of their topic distributions with given documents. We show that our model significantly improves the translation performance over the baseline on NIST Chinese-to-English translation experiments. Our model also achieves a better performance and a faster speed than previous approaches that work at the word level.",A Topic Similarity Model for Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation,Topic Similarity Modeling for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation,A Topic Similarity Model for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation Using Synchronous Rule Level for SMT,,Topic Similarity Model for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation,A Topic Similarity Model for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation,Topic Similarity Modeling for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation

The approach utilizes an unsupervised clustering technique over a rich feature space of biographic facts, which are automatically extracted via a language-independent bootstrapping process. The induced clustering of named entities are then partitioned and linked to their real referents via the automatically extracted biographic data. Performance is evaluated based on both a test set of handlabeled multi-referent personal names and via automatically generated pseudonames.",Unsupervised Personal Name Disambiguation,Unsupervised Clustering of Personal Names with Multiple Real Referents,Unsupervised Personal Name Extraction from Multi-Referent Data using Pseudo-on-line Clustering of Ent,,Unsupervised Clustering of Personal Names with Multiple Real Referents,Identifying Personal Names with Multiple Real Referents,Unsupervised Clustering of Personal Names with Multiple Real Referents
227,"Syntactic constituency parsing is a fundamental problem in natural language processing and has been the subject of intensive research and engineering for decades. As a result, the most accurate parsers are domain specific, complex, and inefficient. In this paper we show that the domain agnostic attention-enhanced sequence-to-sequence model achieves state-of-the-art results on the most widely used syntactic constituency parsing dataset, when trained on a large synthetic corpus that was annotated using existing parsers. It also matches the performance of standard parsers when trained only on a small human-annotated dataset, which shows that this model is highly data-efficient, in contrast to sequence-to-sequence models without the attention mechanism. Our parser is also fast, processing over a hundred sentences per second with an unoptimized CPU implementation.",Grammar as a Foreign Language,,Attention-enhanced Sequence-to-Sequence Parsing for Syntactic Constituency Parsing with Domain Agnostic,Domain Agnostic Attention-enhanced Sequence-to-Sequence Model for Syntactic Constituency Parsing,Domain agnostic Attention-Enhanced Sequence-to-Sequence Parsing,Domain-Agnostic Attention-Enhanced Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Syntactic Constituency Parsing,A Sequence-to-Sequence Model for Syntactic Constituency Parsing with Attention
228,"Stochastic variance reduction algorithms have recently become popular for minimizing the average of a large, but finite number of loss functions on a Riemannian manifold. The present paper proposes a Riemannian stochastic recursive gradient algorithm (R-SRG), which does not require the inverse of retraction between two distant iterates on the manifold. Convergence analyses of R-SRG are performed on both retractionconvex and non-convex functions under computationally efficient retraction and vector transport operations. The key challenge is analysis of the influence of vector transport along the retraction curve. Numerical evaluations reveal that R-SRG competes well with state-of-the-art Riemannian batch and stochastic gradient algorithms.",Riemannian Stochastic Recursive Gradient Algorithm,Riemannian Stochastic Recursive Gradient Algorithm,Riemannian stochastic gradient descent for vector transport and R-SRG with distant iterates on the manifold.,Riemannian Stochastic Recursive Gradient Algorithms,A Riemannian Stochastic Recursive Gradient Algorithm,Riemannian Stochastic Recursive Gradient Algorithm,
