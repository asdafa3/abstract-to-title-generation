0,"Zero-shot translation, translating between language pairs on which a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system has never been trained, is an emergent property when training the system in multilingual settings. However, naive training for zero-shot NMT easily fails, and is sensitive to hyper-parameter setting. The performance typically lags far behind the more conventional pivot-based approach which translates twice using a third language as a pivot. In this work, we address the degeneracy problem due to capturing spurious correlations by quantitatively analyzing the mutual information between language IDs of the source and decoded sentences. Inspired by this analysis, we propose to use two simple but effective approaches: (1) decoder pre-training; (2) back-translation. These methods show significant improvement (4 22 BLEU points) over the vanilla zero-shot translation on three challenging multilingual datasets, and achieve similar or better results than the pivot-based approach.",Improved Zero-shot Neural Machine Translation via Ignoring Spurious Correlations,,Zero-Shot Neural Machine Translation as a Pivot-Based Degeneration of Spurious Correlation between Source and Target Decoding,Pre-training and Back-translation for Zero-Shot Neural Machine Translation in Multilingual Settings,Null-Shot Translation with Decoder Pre-training and Back-Translation, Neural Machine Translation with Arbitrary Correlations,Decoupling the Source Language and the Target Language for Zero-Shot Neural Machine Translation
1,"Biomedical named entities often play important roles in many biomedical text mining tools. However, due to the incompleteness of provided synonyms and numerous variations in their surface forms, normalization of biomedical entities is very challenging. In this paper, we focus on learning representations of biomedical entities solely based on the synonyms of entities. To learn from the incomplete synonyms, we use a model-based candidate selection and maximize the marginal likelihood of the synonyms present in top candidates. Our model-based candidates are iteratively updated to contain more difficult negative samples as our model evolves. In this way, we avoid the explicit pre-selection of negative samples from more than 400K candidates. On four biomedical entity normalization datasets having three different entity types (disease, chemical, adverse reaction), our model BioSyn consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art models almost reaching the upper bound on each dataset.",Biomedical Entity Representations with Synonym Marginalization,Modeling Biomedical Named Entity Normalization with Incomplete Synonyms,,Biomedical Entity Normalization based on the Synonym Selection of Entities,Learning Representations of Biomedical Entities based on Synonyms, Learning Representations of Biomedical Entities Based on Synonyms,Learning Representations of Biomedical Named Entities from Incomplete Synonyms
2,"By describing the features and abstractions of our world, language is a crucial tool for human learning and a promising source of supervision for machine learning models. We use language to improve few-shot visual classification in the underexplored scenario where natural language task descriptions are available during training, but unavailable for novel tasks at test time. Existing models for this setting sample new descriptions at test time and use those to classify images. Instead, we propose language-shaped learning (LSL), an end-to-end model that regularizes visual representations to predict language. LSL is conceptually simpler, more data efficient, and outperforms baselines in two challenging few-shot domains.",Shaping Visual Representations with Language for Few-Shot Classification,Language-shaped Learning for Few-Shot Visual Classification,Language-Shared Few-shot Visual Classification with End-to-End Modeling of Natural Language Descriptors and Abstract,Language-Shaped Learning for Few-Shot Visual Classification,Language-shaped Learning for Few-Shot Visual Classification,,Language-Shaped Learning for Few-Shot Visual Classification
3,"The paper presents an approach to ellipsis resolution in a framework of scope underspecification (Underspecified Discourse Representation Theory). It is argued that the approach improves on previous proposals to integrate ellipsis resolution and scope underspecification (Crouch, 1995; Egg et al., 2001) in that application processes like anaphora resolution do not require full disambiguation but can work directly on the underspecified representation. Furthermore it is shown that the approach presented can cope with the examples discussed by Dalrymple et al. (1991) as well as a problem noted recently by Erk and Koller (2001).",Ellipsis Resolution with Underspecified Scope,E ellipsis resolution and scope underspecification in Underspecified Discourse Representations,Ellipsis Resolution in Underspecified Discourse Representation Theory: An Approach to Ellipsis and Scope Und,,A Framework for ellipsis resolution in scope underspecification, Anaphora Resolution and Scope Underspecification,ellipsis Resolution in an Underspecified Discourse Representation
4,"A number of recent publications have made use of the incremental output of stochastic parsers to derive measures of high utility for psycholinguistic modeling, following the work of Hale (2001; 2003; 2006). In this paper, we present novel methods for calculating separate lexical and syntactic surprisal measures from a single incremental parser using a lexicalized PCFG. We also present an approximation to entropy measures that would otherwise be intractable to calculate for a grammar of that size.

5,"We present a family of priors over probabilistic grammar weights, called the shared logistic normal distribution. This family extends the partitioned logistic normal distribution, enabling factored covariance between the probabilities of different derivation events in the probabilistic grammar, providing a new way to encode prior knowledge about an unknown grammar. We describe a variational EM algorithm for learning a probabilistic grammar based on this family of priors. We then experiment with unsupervised dependency grammar induction and show significant improvements using our model for both monolingual learning and bilingual learning with a non-parallel, multilingual corpus.",Shared Logistic Normal Distributions for Soft Parameter Tying in Unsupervised Grammar Induction,Learning Probabilistic Grammar Priors with Shared Logistic Normal Distributions,Unsupervised Dependency Grammar Induction with Shared Logistic Normal Distributions and Probabilistic Priors over Probabil,A Shared Logistic Normal Distribution for Learning Probabilistic Grammar,Partitioned Logistic Normal Distribution for Probabilistic Grammars,,A Shared Logistic Normal Distribution for Learning Probabilistic Grammars
6,"We analyze human's disagreements about the validity of natural language inferences. We show that, very often, disagreements are not dismissible as annotation ""noise"", but rather persist as we collect more ratings and as we vary the amount of context provided to raters. We further show that the type of uncertainty captured by current state-of-the-art models for natural language inference is not reflective of the type of uncertainty present in human disagreements. We discuss implications of our results in relation to the recognizing textual entailment (RTE)/natural language inference (NLI) task. We argue for a refined evaluation objective that requires models to explicitly capture the full distribution of plausible human judgments.",Inherent Disagreements in Human Textual Inferences,A Refined Evaluation of Human's Discussions about Natural Language Inference,,Exploring Human Disagreement about the Validity of Natural Language Inference Tasks,Understanding the Validity of Natural Language Inferences, Noise vs. Natural Language Inference: An Empirical Study,Analyzing Human Disagreements about the validity of Natural Language Inference
7,"This paper describes an algorithm for detecting empty nodes in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), finding their antecedents, and assigning them function tags, without access to lexical information such as valency. Unlike previous approaches to this task, the current method is not corpus-based, but rather makes use of the principles of early Government-Binding theory (Chomsky, 1981), the syntactic theory that underlies the annotation. Using the evaluation metric proposed by Johnson (2002), this approach outperforms previously published approaches on both detection of empty categories and antecedent identification, given either annotated input stripped of empty categories or the output of a parser. Some problems with this evaluation metric are noted and an alternative is proposed along with the results. The paper considers the reasons a principlebased approach to this problem should outperform corpus-based approaches, and speculates on the possibility of a hybrid approach.",Using Linguistic Principles to Recover Empty Categories,An Evaluation Metric for Empty Node Detection in Penn Treebank,A Corpus-Based Approach to the Automatic Discovery of Empty Categories and Their Antecedents in the Penn Treebank: An,A Principle-Based Approach to Empty Categories in the Penn Treebank,, Detecting Empty Categories and Antecedents in the Penn Treebank,A Principle-Based Approach to Empty Node Detection in the Penn Treebank
8,"When a word sense disambiguation (WSD) system is trained on one domain but applied to a different domain, a drop in accuracy is frequently observed. This highlights the importance of domain adaptation for word sense disambiguation. In this paper, we first show that an active learning approach can be successfully used to perform domain adaptation of WSD systems. Then, by using the predominant sense predicted by expectation-maximization (EM) and adopting a count-merging technique, we improve the effectiveness of the original adaptation process achieved by the basic active learning approach.",Domain Adaptation with Active Learning for Word Sense Disambiguation,Active Learning for Domain Adaptation of Word Sense Disambiguation Systems,Active Domain Adaptation for Word Sense Disambiguation Using Expectation-Maximization Prediction and Count-Merging Techniques,Domain Adaptation of Word Sense Disambiguation Systems,Active Domain Adaptation for Word Sense Disambiguation, Domain Adaptation for Word Sense Disambiguation,

Therefore, it is no surprise that the health domain is a valuable area of interest for emotion detection, as it can provide medical staff or caregivers with essential information about patients. However, progress on this task has been hampered by the absence of large labeled datasets. To this end, we introduce CancerEmo, an emotion dataset created from an online health community and annotated with eight fine-grained emotions. We perform a comprehensive analysis of these emotions and develop deep learning models on the newly created dataset. Our best BERT model achieves an average F1 of 71%, which we improve further using domain-specific pre-training.",CancerEmo: A Dataset for Fine-Grained Emotion Detection,,C CancerEmo: A Dataset for Fine-Grained Emotion Detection and Domain Adaptation in Online Health Community,CancerEmo: A Large-Scale Dataset for Emotion Detection in the Health Domain,CancerEmo: An Emotion Dataset for Emotion Detection, CancerEmo: A Fine-Grained Emotion Dataset for Healthcare,CancerEmo: A Fine-Grained Dataset for Emotion Detection in Health

While operating at the character level, the model makes use of wordlevel and contextual information. In contrast to previous work, the proposed approach learns to correct a variety of error types without guidance of manuallyselected constraints or language-specific features.

12,"Much of human dialogue occurs in semi-cooperative settings, where agents with different goals attempt to agree on common decisions. Negotiations require complex communication and reasoning skills, but success is easy to measure, making this an interesting task for AI. We gather a large dataset of human-human negotiations on a multi-issue bargaining task, where agents who cannot observe each other's reward functions must reach an agreement (or a deal) via natural language dialogue. For the first time, we show it is possible to train end-to-end models for negotiation, which must learn both linguistic and reasoning skills with no annotated dialogue states. We also introduce dialogue rollouts, in which the model plans ahead by simulating possible complete continuations of the conversation, and find that this technique dramatically improves performance.

The approach is based on a Gaussian observation model and Gaussian priors with bilinear equality and inequality constraints. We present an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo inference procedure based on Gibbs sampling. Special cases of the proposed model are Bayesian formulations of nonnegative matrix factorization and factor analysis. The method is evaluated on a blind source separation problem. We demonstrate that our algorithm can be used to extract meaningful and interpretable features that are remarkably different from features extracted using existing related matrix factorization techniques.,Linearly constrained Bayesian matrix factorization for blind source separation,Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization with Linear Constraints,Bayesian Matrix Factorization with Gaussian Priors and Gibbs Sampling Based on Gaussian Observation for Nonnegative Matrix Factor,,Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization Subject to Linear Constraints, Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization,Probabilistic Matrix Factorization with Linear Constraints

Our work considers predicting missing entities (link prediction) and missing time intervals (time prediction) as joint Temporal Knowledge Base Completion (TKBC) tasks, and presents TIMEPLEX, a novel TKBC method, in which entities, relations and, time are all embedded in a uniform, compatible space. TIMEPLEX exploits the recurrent nature of some facts/events and temporal interactions between pairs of relations, yielding state-of-the-art results on both prediction tasks. We also find that existing TKBC models heavily overestimate link prediction performance due to imperfect evaluation mechanisms. In response, we propose improved TKBC evaluation protocols for both link and time prediction tasks, dealing with subtle issues that arise from the partial overlap of time intervals in gold instances and system predictions.",Temporal Knowledge Base Completion: New Algorithms and Evaluation Protocols,Temporal Knowledge Base Completion with Missing Entities and Time Intervals,,TIMEPLEX: Joint Entity and Time Prediction for Temporal Knowledge Base Completion,TIMEPLEX: Joint Temporal Knowledge Base Completion, Joint Temporal Knowledge Base Completion and Time Prediction,Time: A Joint Temporal Knowledge Base Completion Method for Link and Time Prediction

17,"This paper proposes a new computational treatment of lexical rules as used in the HPSG framework. A compiler is described which translates a set of lexical rules and their interaction into a definite clause encoding, which is called by the base lexical entries in the lexicon. This way, the disjunctive possibilities arising from lexical rule application are encoded as systematic covariation in the specification of lexical entries. The compiler ensures the automatic transfer of properties not changed by a lexical rule. Program transformation techniques are used to advance the encoding. The final output of the compiler constitutes an efficient computational counterpart of the linguistic generalizations captured by lexical rules and allows on-the-fly application of lexical rules.",A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules in HPSG as Covariation in Lexical Entries,A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules in HPSG,A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules in HPSG-based Lexical Grammars for Linguistic Generalization,A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules and their Interactions,, A Computational Approach to Lexical Rules,Computational Covariation of Lexical Rules in HPSG

20,"Semantic grammars can be applied both as a language model for a speech recognizer and for semantic parsing, e.g. in order to map the output of a speech recognizer into formal meaning representations. Semantic speech recognition grammars are, however, typically created manually or learned in a supervised fashion, requiring extensive manual effort in both cases. Aiming to reduce this effort, in this paper we investigate the induction of semantic speech recognition grammars under weak supervision. We present empirical results, indicating that the induced grammars support semantic parsing of speech with a rather low loss in performance when compared to parsing of input without recognition errors. Further, we show improved parsing performance compared to applying n-gram models as language models and demonstrate how our semantic speech recognition grammars can be enhanced by weights based on occurrence frequencies, yielding an improvement in parsing performance over applying unweighted grammars.",Semantic parsing of speech using grammars learned with weak supervision,Weakly Supervised Induction of Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars,Inducing Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars under Weak Supervision for Improved Parsing and Semantic Parsing of Speech,Weakly Supervised Induction of Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars,Learning Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars under weak supervision, Improving Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars with Weak Supervision,

Lexicons can be generated using non-parallel corpora or a pivot language, but such lexicons are noisy.

Our algorithm introduces non-aligned signatures (NAS), a cross-lingual word context similarity score that avoids the over-constrained and inefficient nature of alignment-based methods.

Through the nearly isometric nonlinear transformation in the hidden layers, the margin of the linear separating plane in the output layer and the margin of the nonlinear separating boundary in the original data space can be closely related so that the maximum margin classification in the input data space can be achieved approximately via the maximum margin linear classifiers in the output layer.

Reliable cell tracking in time-lapse microscopic image sequences is important for modern biomedical research. Existing cell tracking methods are usually kept simple and use only a small number of features to allow for manual parameter tweaking or grid search. We propose a structured learning approach that allows to learn optimum parameters automatically from a training set. This allows for the use of a richer set of features which in turn affords improved tracking compared to recently reported methods on two public benchmark sequences.,Structured Learning for Cell Tracking,A Structured Learning Approach for Reliable Cell Tracking in Microscapes,Structured Learning for Reliable Cell Tracking in Microscaling Time-Lapse Microscapes: A Structured Learning Approach,Structured Learning for Cell Tracking in Time-Lapse Microscopic Images,Learning to Track a Large Quantity of Homogeneous Objects, Structured Learning for Cell Tracking in Time-Lapse Microarray Sequences,

Since most dependencies are short-distance, common evaluation metrics will be little influenced by how well systems perform on them. We therefore propose an automatic approach for extracting challenge sets rich with long-distance dependencies, and argue that evaluation using this methodology provides a complementary perspective on system performance. To support our claim, we compile challenge sets for English-German and German-English, which are much larger than any previously released challenge set for MT. The extracted sets are large enough to allow reliable automatic evaluation, which makes the proposed approach a scalable and practical solution for evaluating MT performance on the long-tail of syntactic phenomena.",Automatically Extracting Challenge Sets for Non-Local Phenomena in Neural Machine Translation,Towards Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation Systems,Evaluating Machine Translation with Long-distance Dependencies: An Automatic Approach to the State-of-the-Art Trans,,Extraction of Challenge Sets with Long-Distance Dependencies, Extracting Challenge Sets Rich with Long-Distance Dependencies,Automatic Evaluation of Long-Tailed Syntactic Challenges for Transformer MT

We prove that dropout can suppress the strength of interactions between input variables of deep neural networks (DNNs). The theoretic proof is also verified by various experiments. Furthermore, we find that such interactions were strongly related to the over-fitting problem in deep learning. Thus, the utility of dropout can be regarded as decreasing interactions to alleviate the significance of over-fitting. Based on this understanding, we propose an interaction loss to further improve the utility of dropout.

The learned bases provide a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data point x on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination of its nearby anchor points, and the linear weights become its local coordinate coding. We show that a high dimensional nonlinear function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such coding. The method turns a difficult nonlinear learning problem into a simple global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks of traditional local learning methods.",Nonlinear Learning using Local Coordinate Coding,Local Coordinate Coding for Semi-Supervised Nonlinear Manifolds,,A Local Coordinate Coding Scheme for Semi-Supervised Learning on Nonlinear Manifolds,Semi-Supervised Learning on High Dimensional Nonlinear Manifolds, Semi-Supervised Learning on High Dimensional Nonlinear Manifolds,Global Linear Programming for Semi-Supervised Learning on High Dimensional Manifolds

34,"In this paper, we present a novel backward transliteration approach which can further assist the existing statistical model by mining monolingual web resources. Firstly, we employ the syllable-based search to revise the transliteration candidates from the statistical model. By mapping all of them into existing words, we can filter or correct some pseudo candidates and improve the overall recall. Secondly, an AdaBoost model is used to rerank the revised candidates based on the information extracted from monolingual web pages. To get a better precision during the reranking process, a variety of web-based information is exploited to adjust the ranking score, so that some candidates which are less possible to be transliteration names will be assigned with lower ranks. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can significantly outperform the baseline transliteration system in both precision and recall.",Chinese-English Backward Transliteration Assisted with Mining Monolingual Web Pages,Recovering Transliteration Candidates from Monolingual Web Pages for Statistical Machine Translation,Backward Transliteration with Syllable-Based Search Based on Web-based Information Extraction from Monolingual Web,A Novel Backward Transliteration Approach Using Syllable-based Search and Monolingual Web Resources,, Forward Transliteration for Statistical Machine Translation,Exploiting Monolingual Web Resources for Better Recall and Ranking
35,"Existing studies on semantic parsing mainly focus on the in-domain setting. We formulate cross-domain semantic parsing as a domain adaptation problem: train a semantic parser on some source domains and then adapt it to the target domain. Due to the diversity of logical forms in different domains, this problem presents unique and intriguing challenges. By converting logical forms into canonical utterances in natural language, we reduce semantic parsing to paraphrasing, and develop an attentive sequence-to-sequence paraphrase model that is general and flexible to adapt to different domains. We discover two problems, small micro variance and large macro variance, of pre-trained word embeddings that hinder their direct use in neural networks, and propose standardization techniques as a remedy. On the popular Overnight dataset, which contains eight domains, we show that both cross-domain training and standardized pre-trained word embeddings can bring significant improvement.",Cross-domain Semantic Parsing via Paraphrasing,Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing as Domain Adaptation,Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing as Domain Adaptation with Paraphrasing and Pre-Trained Word Embeddings,,Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing as a Domain adaptation problem, Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing as a Domain Adaptation Problem,Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing with Pre-trained Word Embedding
36,The paper introduces a penalized matrix estimation procedure aiming at solutions which are sparse and low-rank at the same time. Such structures arise in the context of social networks or protein interactions where underlying graphs have adjacency matrices which are block-diagonal in the appropriate basis. We introduce a convex mixed penalty which involves `1-norm and trace norm simultaneously. We obtain an oracle inequality which indicates how the two effects interact according to the nature of the target matrix. We bound generalization error in the link prediction problem. We also develop proximal descent strategies to solve the optimization problem efficiently and evaluate performance on synthetic and real data sets.,Estimation of Simultaneously Sparse and Low Rank Matrices.,A Convex Mixed Penalty for Sparse and Low-Rank Matrix Estimation,A Convex Mixed Penalties for Sparse and Low-Rank Matrix Estimation with Application to Protein Interaction Problems.,,A Penalized Matrix Estimation Procedure for Protein Interactions, A Convex Mixed Penalty for Link Prediction,Sparse and Low-Rank Matrix Estimation via Convex Mixed Penalties
37,"In this work, we revisit Shared Task 1 from the 2012 *SEM Conference: the automated analysis of negation. Unlike the vast majority of participating systems in 2012, our approach works over explicit and formal representations of propositional semantics, i.e. derives the notion of negation scope assumed in this task from the structure of logical-form meaning representations. We relate the task-specific interpretation of (negation) scope to the concept of (quantifier and operator) scope in mainstream underspecified semantics. With reference to an explicit encoding of semantic predicate-argument structure, we can operationalize the annotation decisions made for the 2012 *SEM task, and demonstrate how a comparatively simple system for negation scope resolution can be built from an off-the-shelf deep parsing system. In a system combination setting, our approach improves over the best published results on this task to date.",Simple Negation Scope Resolution through Deep Parsing: A Semantic Solution to a Semantic Problem,,Revisiting Shared Task 1: Negation Scope Resolution in Underspecified Semantics with Logical-Form Meaning Represent,Automated Negation Scope Resolution over Explicit and Formal Semantics,Shared Task 1: the Automated Analyse of Negation, Automatic Interpretation of Negation Scope,Revisiting Shared Task 1 from the 2012 *SEM Conference: The Automated Analysis of Negation Scope

Yet statistical parsing has focussed almost exclusively on bilexical dependencies or domain-specific logical forms. We propose a neural encoder-decoder transition-based parser which is the first full-coverage semantic graph parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). The model architecture uses stack-based embedding features, predicting graphs jointly with unlexicalized predicates and their token alignments. Our parser is more accurate than attention-based baselines on MRS, and on an additional Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) benchmark, and GPU batch processing makes it an order of magnitude faster than a high-precision grammar-based parser. Further, the 86.69% Smatch score of our MRS parser is higher than the upper-bound on AMR parsing, making MRS an attractive choice as a semantic representation.",Robust Incremental Neural Semantic Graph Parsing,Neural Transition-based Semantic Graph Parsing for Minimal Recursion Semantics,Neural Encoder-Decoder Transition-based Parsing of Minimal Recursion Semantic Parsers for Natural Language Processing,A Neural Transition-based Parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics,Full-coverage Semantic Graph Parsing for Minimal Recursion Semantics, Neural Decoding for Minimal Recursion Semantics,

Common dithering strategies for exploration, such as ‘-greedy, do not carry out temporally-extended (or deep) exploration; this can lead to exponentially larger data requirements. However, most algorithms for statistically e cient RL are not computationally tractable in complex environments. Randomized value functions o er a promising approach to e cient exploration with generalization, but existing algorithms are not compatible with nonlinearly parameterized value functions. As a first step towards addressing such contexts we develop bootstrapped DQN.

These language models are almost universally autoregressive in nature, generating sentences one token at a time from left to right. This paper studies the influence of token generation order on model quality via a novel two-pass language model that produces partially-filled sentence ""templates"" and then fills in missing tokens. We compare various strategies for structuring these two passes and observe a surprisingly large variation in model quality. We find the most effective strategy generates function words in the first pass followed by content words in the second.

In this work, we conduct an initial attempt to answer these questions on two related subsequent tasks: semantic slot filling in spoken language understanding and named entity recognition. We propose three techniques to solve the mismatch problem: using word segmentation outputs as additional features, adaptation with partial-learning and taking advantage of n-best word segmentation list.

While data augmentation is potentially an effective technique to address the above issue, it is uncontrollable as it may change aspect words and aspect labels unexpectedly. In this paper, we formulate the data augmentation as a conditional generation task: generating a new sentence while preserving the original opinion targets and labels. We propose a masked sequence-to-sequence method for conditional augmentation of aspect term extraction. Unlike existing augmentation approaches, ours is controllable and allows to generate more diversified sentences.

58,"Spoken monologues feature greater sentence length and structural complexity than do spoken dialogues. To achieve high parsing performance for spoken monologues, it could prove effective to simplify the structure by dividing a sentence into suitable language units. This paper proposes a method for dependency parsing of Japanese monologues based on sentence segmentation. In this method, the dependency parsing is executed in two stages: at the clause level and the sentence level. First, the dependencies within a clause are identified by dividing a sentence into clauses and executing stochastic dependency parsing for each clause. Next, the dependencies over clause boundaries are identified stochastically, and the dependency structure of the entire sentence is thus completed. An experiment using a spoken monologue corpus shows this method to be effective for efficient dependency parsing of Japanese monologue sentences.",Dependency Parsing of Japanese Spoken Monologue Based on Clause Boundaries,Dependency Parsing of Japanese Monologues Based on Sentence Segmentation,Dependency Parsing of Japanese Monologue Sentences Using Sentence Segmentation and Stochastic Dependency Parser,Sentence Segmentation for Dependency Parsing of Japanese Monologues,, Dependency Parsing of Japanese Monologues Using Sentence Segmentation,Dependency Parsing of Japanese Spoken Monologues Based on Sentence Segmentation

Understanding the correct meaning of a syntactic form is of great importance to many NLP applications.

It approximates the nonnegative data in an original high dimensional space with a linear representation in a low dimensional space by using the product of two nonnegative matrices. In many applications with data such as human faces or digits, data often reside on multiple manifolds, which may overlap or intersect. But the traditional NMF method and other existing variants of NMF do not consider this. This paper proposes a novel clustering algorithm that explicitly models the intrinsic geometrical structure of the data on multiple manifolds with NMF. The idea of the proposed algorithm is that a data point generated by several neighboring points on a specific manifold in the original space should be constructed in a similar way in the low dimensional subspace. A set of experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm.",Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Clustering on Multiple Manifolds,Multi-Manifold Nonnegative Matrix Factorization.,Nonnegative Matrix Factorization on Manifolds with Intrinsic Geometrical Structure for Multiple Manifold Manif,Clustering on Multiple Manifolds with Nonnegative Matrix Factorization,Clustering Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for High Dimensional Space,,Clustering on Multiple Manifolds with Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
71,"We present two language models based upon an “immediate-head” parser — our name for a parser that conditions all events below a constituent c upon the head of c. While all of the most accurate statistical parsers are of the immediate-head variety, no previous grammatical language model uses this technology. The perplexity for both of these models significantly improve upon the trigram model base-line as well as the best previous grammarbased language model. For the better of our two models these improvements are 24% and 14% respectively. We also suggest that improvement of the underlying parser should significantly improve the model’s perplexity and that even in the near term there is a lot of potential for improvement in immediatehead language models.",Immediate-Head Parsing for Language Models,Improvements in an Immediate-Head Language Model Based on a Grammatical Parser,Parsing with an Immediate-Head Parser and its Application to the trigram base-line Grammatical language model,An Immediate-Head Parser for Statistical Language Models,, Improving Grammatical Language Modeling by Immediate-Heading Parsing,Two Immediate-Head Grammatical Language Models
72,"Scoring sentences in documents given abstract summaries created by humans is important in extractive multi-document summarization. In this paper, we formulate extractive summarization as a two step learning problem building a generative model for pattern discovery and a regression model for inference. We calculate scores for sentences in document clusters based on their latent characteristics using a hierarchical topic model. Then, using these scores, we train a regression model based on the lexical and structural characteristics of the sentences, and use the model to score sentences of new documents to form a summary. Our system advances current state-of-the-art improving ROUGE scores by ∼7%.

74,"Neural encoder-decoder models have been successful in natural language generation tasks. However, real applications of abstractive summarization must consider an additional constraint that a generated summary should not exceed a desired length. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective extension of a sinusoidal positional encoding (Vaswani et al., 2017) so that a neural encoder-decoder model preserves the length constraint. Unlike previous studies that learn length embeddings, the proposed method can generate a text of any length even if the target length is unseen in training data. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able not only to control generation length but also improve ROUGE scores.",Positional Encoding to Control Output Sequence Length,A Simple but Effective Extension of a sinusoidal positional encoding for Abstractive Summarization,A Simple and Effective Extension of Neural Encoder-Decoder Models for Abstractive Summarization Using a Sinusoidal Position,Learning Length Embeddings for Abstractive Summarization with Neural Encoder-Decoder Models,Sinusoidal Positional Encoding for Neural Language Generation, A Sinusoidal Neural Encoder-Decoder Model for Abstractive Summarization,

We start by giving a closed form solution for the definition of the optimal weights of a linear autoencoder given a training set of sequences. This solution, however, is computationally very demanding, so we suggest a procedure to get an approximate solution for a given number of hidden units. The weights obtained for the linear autoencoder are then used as initial weights for the inputto-hidden connections of a recurrent neural network, which is then trained on the desired task. Using four well known datasets of sequences of polyphonic music, we show that the proposed pre-training approach is highly effective, since it allows to largely improve the state of the art results on all the considered datasets.",Pre-training of Recurrent Neural Networks via Linear Autoencoders,Pre-training for Recurrent Neural Networks with Linear Autoencoder Networks,,Pre-training of Linear Autoencoder Networks for Recurrent Neural Networks,Pre-training for Recurrent Neural Networks with Linear Autoencoder Networks, Training Recurrent Neural Networks with Linear Autoencoders,Pre-training of Linear Autoencoder Networks for Sequences

Cross-language sentiment classification (CLSC) can leverage the rich resources in one language (source language) for sentiment classification in a resource-scarce language (target language). Bilingual embeddings could eliminate the semantic gap between two languages for CLSC, but ignore the sentiment information of text. This paper proposes an approach to learning bilingual sentiment word embeddings (BSWE) for English-Chinese CLSC. The proposed BSWE incorporate sentiment information of text into bilingual embeddings. Furthermore, we can learn high-quality BSWE by simply employing labeled corpora and their translations, without relying on largescale parallel corpora.

The algorithm is of heuristic nature and it uses as unique evidence for clustering the identification of cognate named entities between both sides of the comparable corpora. One of the main advantages of this approach is that it does not depend on bilingual or multilingual resources. However, it depends on the possibility of identifying cognate named entities between the languages used in the corpus. An additional advantage of the approach is that it does not need any information about the right number of clusters; the algorithm calculates it. We have tested this approach with a comparable corpus of news written in English and Spanish. In addition, we have compared the results with a system which translates selected document features. The obtained results are encouraging.",Multilingual Document Clustering: An Heuristic Approach Based on Cognate Named Entities,Multilingual Document Clustering in Comparable Corpora Using Heuristic Data,Multilingual Document Clustering in Comparable Corpora: Identifying Cognate Named Entities by Means of Heuristic Information,Multilingual Document Clustering in Comparable Corpora using Cognate Named Entities,Multilingual Document Clustering in Comparable Corpora, Multilingual Document Clustering Using Comparable Corpora,

Many techniques such as data augmentation and novel regularizers such as Dropout have been proposed to prevent overfitting without requiring a massive amount of training data. In this work, we propose a new regularizer called DeCov which leads to significantly reduced overfitting (as indicated by the difference between train and val performance), and better generalization. Our regularizer encourages diverse or non-redundant representations in Deep Neural Networks by minimizing the cross-covariance of hidden activations. This simple intuition has been explored in a number of past works but surprisingly has never been applied as a regularizer in supervised learning. Experiments across a range of datasets and network architectures show that this loss always reduces overfitting while almost always maintaining or increasing generalization performance and often improving performance over Dropout.",Reducing Overfitting in Deep Networks by Decorrelating Representations,DeCov: Reducing Overfitting in Deep Neural Networks by Minimizing Cross-Covariance,DeCov: DeCov Regularized Training of Deep Neural Networks via Cross-Covariance and Generalization.,DeCov: A Cross-Covariance Regularizer for Deep Neural Networks,DeCov: Regularizing Deep Neural Networks for Overfitting, DeCov: DeCov Regularization for Deep Neural Networks,

93,"Information-theoretic measures are among the most standard techniques for evaluation of clustering methods including word sense induction (WSI) systems. Such measures rely on sample-based estimates of the entropy. However, the standard maximum likelihood estimates of the entropy are heavily biased with the bias dependent on, among other things, the number of clusters and the sample size. This makes the measures unreliable and unfair when the number of clusters produced by different systems vary and the sample size is not exceedingly large. This corresponds exactly to the setting of WSI evaluation where a ground-truth cluster sense number arguably does not exist and the standard evaluation scenarios use a small number of instances of each word to compute the score. We describe more accurate entropy estimators and analyze their performance both in simulations and on evaluation of WSI systems.",Improved Estimation of Entropy for Evaluation of Word Sense Induction,Evaluating Word Sense Induction Systems Using Entropy Estimation,Evaluation of Word Sense Induction Using Entropy Estimation Measures and the Sample Size of Clustering Schemes,Evaluation of Word Sense Induction Systems Based on Sample-Based Entropy Estimation,, Evaluating Clustering Methods Using Word Sense Induction,On the Accuracy of Entropy Estimation for Word Sense Induction

Yet there is evidence that differences between annotators are not always random attention slips but could result from different biases towards the classification categories, at least for the harder-to-decide cases.

However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality.",Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation,An Unsupervised Method for Domain Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translation,Unsupervised SMT Induction of Phrase-Based Translation Models from Monolingual Corpora with Application to Domain Adaptation,Unsupervised Unfolding of Phrase-based Translation Model for Domain Adaptation,Inducing a Simple Word-Based Translation Model from the Monolingual Corpora, Unsupervised Phrase-Based Translation Model for Domain Adaptation,

In order for the relationships between the game elements to be natural, common-sense has to be encoded into arrangement of the elements. In this work, we investigate a machine learning approach for world creation using content from the multiplayer text adventure game environment LIGHT (Urbanek et al. 2019). We introduce neural network based models to compositionally arrange locations, characters, and objects into a coherent whole. In addition to creating worlds based on existing elements, our models can generate new game content. Humans can also leverage our models to interactively aid in worldbuilding. We show that the game environments created with our approach are cohesive, diverse, and preferred by human evaluators compared to other machine learning based world construction algorithms.",Generating Interactive Worlds with Text,Learning to Generate Cohesive and Efficient Games using Content from Online Games,Learning to Generate Cohesive Games Using Neural Network-based Content from the Online World-Building Task in Multi-player Text,,Machine Learning for World Creation using Multiplayer Text Adventure Game Environments, Cohesive and Interesting World Creation Using Neural Networks,Multiplayer Text Adventure Games with Compositional Neural Networks

Unfortunately, they are also very brittle and easily falter when presented with noisy data. In this paper, we confront NMT models with synthetic and natural sources of noise. We find that state-of-the-art models fail to translate even moderately noisy texts that humans have no trouble comprehending. We explore two approaches to increase model robustness: structure-invariant word representations and robust training on noisy texts. We find that a model based on a character convolutional neural network is able to simultaneously learn representations robust to multiple kinds of noise.",Synthetic and Natural Noise Both Break Neural Machine Translation,Character-Based Neural Machine Translation with Noisy Texts,Character-Based Neural Machine Translation with Synthetic and Natural Sources of Noise: A Case Study on Noisy Texts in N,Robust Neural Machine Translation with Synthetic and Natural Sources of Noisy Data,Robust Character-Based Neural Machine Translation,,Character-Based Neural Machine Translation Fails to Translate Noisy Texts

When training with Dropout, a randomly selected subset of activations are set to zero within each layer. DropConnect instead sets a randomly selected subset of weights within the network to zero. Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect. We then evaluate DropConnect on a range of datasets, comparing to Dropout, and show state-of-the-art results on several image recognition benchmarks by aggregating multiple DropConnect-trained models.",Regularization of Neural Networks using DropConnect,DropConnect: A Generalization of Dropout for Regularizing Neural Networks,DropConnect: Regularizing Fully-Connected Networks via Randomized Subset Selection and Multiple Drop-Connecting Data Aggregation,DropConnect: A Generalization of Dropout for Fully-Connected Neural Networks,DropConnect: A Generalization of Dropout in Neural Networks,,Dropout Meets DropConnect: Regularizing Fully-Connected Neural Networks

Given labeled data annotated with frame-semantic parses, we learn a model that projects the set of word representations for the syntactic context around a predicate to a low dimensional representation. The latter is used for semantic frame identification; with a standard argument identification method inspired by prior work, we achieve state-ofthe-art results on FrameNet-style framesemantic analysis.

Given a collection of trained models, we measure the similarity of their internal representations and attention. Critically, these models come from vastly different architectures. We use existing and novel similarity measures that aim to gauge the level of localization of information in the deep models, and facilitate the investigation of which design factors affect model similarity, without requiring any external linguistic annotation. The analysis reveals that models within the same family are more similar to one another, as may be expected. Surprisingly, different architectures have rather similar representations, but different individual neurons. We also observed differences in information localization in lower and higher layers and found that higher layers are more affected by fine-tuning on downstream tasks.",Similarity Analysis of Contextual Word Representation Models,,Similarity Analysis of Contextual Word Representations: A Case Study on Information Localization in the Lens of Similarity Analysis.,Similarity Analysis of Contextual Word Representations in Deep Learning,Similarity Measures for Contextual Word Representations, Contextual Word Representation Models,Comparing Neural Architectures of Contextual Word Representations

114,"Recently, work in NLP was initiated on a type of opinion inference that arises when opinions are expressed toward events which have positive or negative effects on entities (+/-effect events). This paper addresses methods for creating a lexicon of such events, to support such work on opinion inference. Due to significant sense ambiguity, our goal is to develop a sense-level rather than word-level lexicon. To maximize the effectiveness of different types of information, we combine a graph-based method using WordNet1 relations and a standard classifier using gloss information. A hybrid between the two gives the best results. Further, we provide evidence that the model is an effective way to guide manual annotation to find +/-effect senses that are not in the seed set.",+/-EffectWordNet: Sense-level Lexicon Acquisition for Opinion Inference,A Sense-Level Lexicon for Opinion Inference in NLP,A Sense-Level Lexicon of Events Using WordNet1 Relations and Gloss Information for Opinion Inference on Entities +/-,A Graph-based Lexicon of +/--Effect Events,, A Sense-Level Lexicon for Opinion Inference,A Sense-Level Lexicon for Opinion Inference

In this paper, we scale up the integration of SWSD into contextual opinion analysis and still obtain improvements in performance, by successfully gathering data annotated by non-expert annotators. Further, by improving the method for integrating SWSD into contextual opinion analysis, even greater benefits from SWSD are achieved than in previous work.

Prior zero-shot slot filling models use slot descriptions to learn concepts, but are not robust to misaligned schemas.

The main algorithm for this problem is disagreement-based active learning, which has a high label requirement. Thus a major challenge is to find an algorithm which achieves better label complexity, is consistent in an agnostic setting, and applies to general classification problems.

In this paper, we propose a simple technique to improve a generalization ability of deep RL agents by introducing a randomized (convolutional) neural network that randomly perturbs input observations. It enables trained agents to adapt to new domains by learning robust features invariant across varied and randomized environments. Furthermore, we consider an inference method based on the Monte Carlo approximation to reduce the variance induced by this randomization.

However, the brittleness of existing neural net approaches is revealed by notable failures, such as the existence of adversarial examples that are misclassified despite being nearly identical to a training example, or the inability of recurrent sequence-processing nets to stay on track without teacher forcing. We introduce a method, which we refer to as state reification, that involves modeling the distribution of hidden states over the training data and then projecting hidden states observed during testing toward this distribution. Our intuition is that if the network can remain in a familiar manifold of hidden space, subsequent layers of the net should be well trained to respond appropriately. We show that this state-reification method helps neural nets to generalize better, especially when labeled data are sparse, and also helps overcome the challenge of achieving robust generalization with adversarial training.",State-Reification Networks: Improving Generalization by Modeling the Distribution of Hidden Representations,State Reification for Robust Generalization in Neural Networks,State Reification for Robust Neural Net Generalization with Adversarial Training of Finite-Labeled Data via Hidden State,,State Reification for Neural Nets to Generalize, State Reification for Neural Networks,State Reification for Robust Neural Nets

We implement and test four quantitative theories, all of which are theoretically motivated in terms of efficiency in human language production and comprehension. The four theories we test are subjectivity (Scontras et al., 2017), information locality (Futrell, 2019), integration cost (Dyer, 2017), and information gain, which we introduce. We evaluate theories based on their ability to predict orders of unseen adjectives in hand-parsed and automatically-parsed dependency treebanks. We find that subjectivity, information locality, and information gain are all strong predictors, with some evidence for a two-factor account, where subjectivity and information gain reflect a factor involving semantics, and information locality reflects collocational preferences.",What determines the order of adjectives in English?

A setting of particular interest is when the clients are mobile devices, where two important concerns are communication efficiency and the privacy of the clients. Several recent works have focused on reducing the communication cost or introducing privacy guarantees, but none of the proposed communication efficient methods are known to be privacy preserving and none of the known privacy mechanisms are known to be communication efficient. To this end, we study algorithms that achieve both communication efficiency and differential privacy. For d variables and n ⇡ d clients, the proposed method uses O(log log(nd)) bits of communication per client per coordinate and ensures constant privacy.
