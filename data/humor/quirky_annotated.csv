0,1,"Data mining approaches have been increasingly applied to the electronic health record and have led to the discovery of numerous clinical associations. Recent data mining studies have suggested a potential association between cat bites and human depression. To explore this possible association in more detail we first used administrative diagnosis codes to identify patients with either depression or bites, drawn from a population of 1.3 million patients. We then conducted a manual chart review in the electronic health record of all patients with a code for a bite to accurately determine which were from cats or dogs. Overall there were 750 patients with cat bites, 1,108 with dog bites, and approximately 117,000 patients with depression. Depression was found in 41.3% of patients with cat bites and 28.7% of those with dog bites. Furthermore, 85.5% of those with both cat bites and depression were women, compared to 64.5% of those with dog bites and depression. The probability of a woman being diagnosed with depression at some point in her life if she presented to our health system with a cat bite was 47.0%, compared to 24.2% of men presenting with a similar bite. The high proportion of depression in patients who had cat bites, especially among women, suggests that screening for depression could be appropriate in patients who present to a clinical provider with a cat bite. Additionally, while no causative link is known to explain this association, there is growing evidence to suggest that the relationship between cats and human mental illness, such as depression, warrants further investigation.",Describing the relationship between cat bites and human depression using data from an electronic health record,0.5
1,2,"Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks—in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.",Rules for Biologically Inspired Adaptive Network Design,-1.0
2,5,"Pain is modulated by cognitive factors, including attention and emotions. In this study we evaluated the distractive effect of aesthetic appreciation on subjectively rated pain (visual analogue scale;VAS) and multi-channel evoked potentials induced by CO2 laser stimulation of the left hand in twelve healthy volunteers. Subjects were stimulated by laser in the absence of other external stimulation (baseline condition) and while looking at different paintings they had previously rated as beautiful, neutral or ugly. The view of paintings previously appreciated as beautiful produced lower pain scores and a clear inhibition of the P2 wave amplitude, localized in the anterior cingulate cortex; the inhibition of P2 wave amplitude was lesser or not significant during the presentation of the ugly or neutral paintings, respectively. Dipole source localization analysis of the LEP peaks showed significant changes during different conditions, with a shift from the posterior to the anterior right cingulated cortex while looking at paintings previously rated as beautiful.Our results provide evidence that pain may be modulated at cortical level by the aesthetic content of the distracting stimuli.

3,14,"Despite the increasing interest in twin studies and the stunning amount of research on face recognition, the ability of adult identical twins to discriminate their own faces from those of their co-twins has been scarcely investigated. One’s own face is the most distinctive feature of the bodily self, and people typically show a clear advantage in recognizing their own face even more than other very familiar identities. Given the very high level of resemblance of their faces, monozygotic twins represent a unique model for exploring self-face processing. Herein we examined the ability of monozygotic twins to distinguish their own face from the face of their co-twin and of a highly familiar individual. Results show that twins equally recognize their own face and their twin’s face. This lack of self-face advantage was negatively predicted by how much they felt physically similar to their co-twin and by their anxious or avoidant attachment style. We speculate that in monozygotic twins, the visual representation of the self-face overlaps with that of the co-twin. Thus, to distinguish the self from the co-twin, monozygotic twins have to rely much more than control participants on the multisensory integration processes upon which the sense of bodily self is based. Moreover, in keeping with the notion that attachment style influences perception of self and significant others, we propose that the observed self/co-twin confusion may depend upon insecure attachment.",Is That Me or My Twin?

4,16,"We measured the frictional coefficient under banana skin on floor material. Force transducer with six degrees of freedom was set under a flat panel of linoleum. Both frictional force and vertical force were simultaneously measured during a shoe sole was pushed and rubbed by a foot motion on the panel with banana skin. Measured frictional coefficient was about 0.07. This was much lower than the value on common materials and similar one on well lubricated surfaces. By the microscopic observation, it was estimated that polysaccharide follicular gel played the dominant role in lubricating effect of banana skin after the crush and the change to homogeneous sol.",Frictional Coefficient under Banana Skin,0.25

6,25,"Previously we showed that swearing produces a pain lessening (hypoalgesic) effect for many people. This paper assesses whether habituation to swearing occurs such that people who swear more frequently in daily life show a lesser pain tolerance effect of swearing, compared with people who swear less frequently. Pain outcomes were assessed in participants asked to repeat a swear word versus a nonswear word. Additionally, sex differences and the roles of pain catastroph- izing, fear of pain, and daily swearing frequency were explored. Swearing increased pain tolerance and heart rate compared with not swearing. Moreover, the higher the daily swearing frequency, the less was the benefit for pain tolerance when swearing, compared with when not swearing. This pa- per shows apparent habituation related to daily swearing frequency, consistent with our theory that the underlying mechanism by which swearing increases pain tolerance is the provocation of an emo- tional response.",Swearing as a Response to Pain—Effect of Daily Swearing Frequency,0.25
7,26,"With each eye fixation, we experience a richly detailed visual world. Yet recent work on visual integration and change direction reveals that we are surprisingly unaware of the details of our environment from one view to the next: we often do not detect large changes to objects and scenes ('change blindness'). Furthermore, without attention, we may not even perceive objects ('inattentional blindness'). Taken together, these findings suggest that we perceive and remember only those objects and details that receive focused attention. In this paper, we briefly review and discuss evidence for these cognitive forms of 'blindness'. We then present a new study that builds on classic studies of divided visual attention to examine inattentional blindness for complex objects and events in dynamic scenes. Our results suggest that the likelihood of noticing an unexpected object depends on the similarity of that object to other objects in the display and on how difficult the priming monitoring task is. Interestingly, spatial proximity of the critical unattended object to attended locations does not appear to affect detection, suggesting that observers attend to objects and events, not spatial positions. We discuss the implications of these results for visual representations and awareness of our visual environment.",Gorillas in our midst: sustained inattentional blindness for dynamic events,0.75
8,36,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of wet underwear and to compare any influence of fibre-type material and textile construction of underwear on thermoregulatory responses and thermal comfort of humans during rest in the cold. Long-legged/long-sleeved underwear manufactured from 100% polypropylene in a 1-by-1 rib knit structure was tested dry and wet as part of a two-layer clothing system. In addition cotton (1-by-1 rib knit), wool (1-by-1 rib knit), polypropylene (fishnet), and a double-layer material manufactured from 47% wool and 53% polypropylene (interlock knit) was tested wet in the clothing system. In the wet condition 175 g of water was distributed in the underwear prior to the experiment. The test was done on eight men (T(a) = 10 degrees C, RH = 85%, V(a) < 0.1 m/s), and comprised a 60 min resting period. Skin temperature, rectal temperature, and weight loss were recorded during the test. Total changes in body and clothing weight were measured separately. Furthermore, subjective ratings on thermal comfort and sensation were collected. The tests demonstrated the significant cooling effect of wet underwear on thermoregulatory responses and thermal comfort. Further, the tests showed that textile construction of underwear in a two-layer clothing ensemble has an effect on the evaporation rate from clothing during rest in the cold resulting in a significant difference in mean skin temperature. The thickness of the underwear has more of an influence on the thermoregulatory responses and thermal comfort, than the types of fibres tested.",Impact of wet underwear on thermoregulatory responses and thermal comfort in the cold,-0.25

10,56,"Information on (changes in) standing and lying behaviour of cows can be used for oestrus detection, early diagnosis of disorders and to evaluate welfare consequences of changes in housing and management. Data sets on lying and standing behaviour were collected from cows with IceTag™ sensors fitted to the leg. Data were obtained with 10 late-pregnant indoor-housed beef cows (Exp. 1), 19 out-wintered beef cows (Exp. 2) and 44 housed lactating dairy cows that were milked three times daily (Exp. 3). During part of Exp. 1 video footage was recorded to validate the sensor records. Data were analysed with the aims of estimating objective lying and standing bout criteria and to test two hypotheses. These hypotheses were that (i) the probability of cows standing up would increase with the length of time the animal had been lying down and (ii) the probability of cows lying down would increase with the length of time the animal had been standing. A total of 10,814, 39,089 and 9405 lying episodes were recorded by the sensors in Exp. 1–3, respectively. On the basis of log–survivorship plots, frequency distributions of (log-transformed) lying episode lengths and analysis of the correspondence between recorded lying episodes and video footage of lying behaviour, a minimum lying bout criterion of 4 min was indicated. Application of this criterion reduced the number of lying episodes by between 62% and 88% in the three experiments, even though this had only minor effects on total estimated lying and standing time (changes between 0.5% and 3.2%). Out-wintered beef cows tended to have fewer but longer lying bouts than the other groups and dairy cows had the shortest total lying time. (11.6, 10.5 and 10.2 h/day in Exp. 1–3, respectively). The probability of cows standing up within the next 15 min increased (P < 0.001) with lying time in all experiments, which was consistent with the first hypothesis. The probability of cows lying down within the next 15 min did not significantly increase with standing time. This lack of change in probability was not caused by pooling of data across day and night or across cows with different behavioural strategies. Our second hypothesis was, therefore, refuted because cows were not more likely to lie down the longer they had been standing.",Are cows more likely to lie down the longer they stand?,0.25
11,57,"Wheat breakfast flakes were compacted in a cylindrical geometry using two different techniques and the volume measured as a function of applied pressure from 100 Pa to 85 MPa. The effect of water content, in the range 4 to 18% (wet weight basis), on the compaction behaviour of the flakes was examined for pressures from 1 to 85 MPa. The data were analysed using different relationships between density and applied pressure in accordance with Peleg, Kawakita and Heckel. The Heckel deformation stress decreased as the water content increased up to 12% and became inaccurate at 18% water. The Peleg compressibility and Kawakita yield stress only showed a marked decrease from 12 to 18% water. Collectively, these results agree qualitatively with other observations of the decrease in stiffness of single flakes over this water content range.",A study of the effects of water content on the compaction behaviour of breakfast cereal flakes,0.0
12,60,"Face pareidolia is the illusory perception of non-existent faces. The present study, for the first time, contrasted behavioral and neural responses of face pareidolia with those of letter pareidolia to explore face-specific behavioral and neural responses during illusory face processing. Participants were shown pure-noise images but were led to believe that 50% of them contained either faces or letters; they reported seeing faces or letters illusorily 34% and 38% of the time, respectively. The right fusiform face area (rFFA) showed a specific response when participants “saw” faces as opposed to letters in the pure-noise images. Behavioral responses during face pareidolia produced a classification image (CI) that resembled a face, whereas those during letter pareidolia produced a CI that was letter-like. Further, the extent to which such behavioral CIs resembled faces was directly related to the level of face-specific activations in the rFFA. This finding suggests that the rFFA plays a specific role not only in processing of real faces but also in illusory face perception, perhaps serving to facilitate the interaction between bottom-up information from the primary visual cortex and top-down signals from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Whole brain analyses revealed a network specialized in face pareidolia, including both the frontal and occipitotemporal regions. Our findings suggest that human face processing has a strong top-down component whereby sensory input with even the slightest suggestion of a face can result in the interpretation of a face.

According to the mental-number-line theory, people mentally represent numbers along a line with smaller numbers on the left and larger numbers on the right. We hypothesized that surreptitiously making people lean to the right or to the left would affect their quantitative estimates. Participants answered estimation questions while standing on a Wii Balance Board. Posture was manipulated within subjects so that participants answered some questions while they leaned slightly to the left, some questions while they leaned slightly to the right, and some questions while they stood upright.

14,67,"When a half-full Bordeaux glass is oscillated sideways at 4Hz, calm waves of wine gently ripple upon the surface. However, when a cylindrical mug is subject to the same motion, it does not take long for the liquid to splash aggressively against the cup and ultimately spill. This is a manifestation of the same principles that also make us spill coffee when we walk. In this study, we first investigate the physical properties of the fluid-structure interaction of the coffee cup; in particular, the frequency spectrum of each oscillating component is examined methodically. It is revealed that the cup's oscillation is not monochromatic: harmonic modes exist, and their proportions are significant. As a result, although the base frequency of the cup is considerably displaced from the resonance region, maximum spillage is initiated by the second harmonic mode of driving force that the cup exerts on its contents. Thus, we spill coffee. As an application of these experimental findings, a number of methods to reduce liquid spillage are investigated. Most notably, an alternative method to hold the cup is suggested; in essence, by altering the mechanical structure of the cup-holding posture, we can effectively suppress the higher frequency components of the driving force and thus stabilize the liquid oscillation. In an attempt to rationalize all we have investigated above, a mechanical model is proposed. Due to practicalities, rather than to construct a dynamical system using Newton's equation of motion, we choose to utilize the Euler-Lagrangian equations. Extensive simulation studies reveal that our model, crude in its form, successfully embodies the essential facets of reality. This liberates us to make two predictions that were beyond our experimental limits: the change in magnitude of the driving force and the temporal stabilization process.

15,73,"To investigate the hypothesis that wearing socks over shoes improves traction on icy footpaths. Randomised controlled trial involving 30 pedestrians (median age 21 years, range 18-70) travelling in a downhill direction on icy public footpaths at two sites in Dunedin, New Zealand. Intervention: different coloured socks applied over normal footwear or usual practice (unadulterated footwear). Primary outcome: difference in mean self-reported slipperiness on a 5-point scale. Secondary outcomes: falls, observer-rated slipperiness, observer-rated confidence, time to descend study slope. Two-thirds of participants (65%) had previously fallen on ice. Wearing socks over normal footwear was associated with a statistically significant improvement in traction; the difference in mean self-reported slipperiness scores between the control (n=15) and intervention (n=14) groups was 1.3 (95%CI: 0.4-2.3). Agreement between self-rated and observer-rated slipperiness was high (r=0.70). A higher proportion of the intervention group (71% vs 53%) appeared confident. One member of the control group fell. There was no evidence of risk compensation in the intervention group (difference in mean descent times 1.9 seconds, 95%CI: -6.1-10.0). The only adverse events were short periods of indignity for some members of the intervention group. Wearing socks over shoes appears to be an effective and inexpensive method to reduce the likelihood of slipping on icy footpaths.

Information about this physiology and pathology can be derived from observations on the condemned persons, postmortem examinations, physiological studies on animals undergoing similar procedures, and the literature on emergency medicine. It is difficult to know how much pain the person being executed feels or for how long, because many of the signs of pain are obscured by the procedure or by physical restraints, but one can identify those steps which are likely to be painful. The general view has been that most of the methods used are virtually painless, and lead to rapid dignified death.

18,93,"Although bullshit is common in everyday life and has attracted attention from philosophers, its reception (critical or ingen- uous) has not, to our knowledge, been subject to empirical investigation. Here we focus on pseudo-profound bullshit, which consists of seemingly impressive assertions that are presented as true and meaningful but are actually vacuous. We presented participants with bullshit statements consisting of buzzwords randomly organized into statements with syntactic structure but no discernible meaning (e.g., “Wholeness quiets infinite phenomena”). Across multiple studies, the propensity to judge bull- shit statements as profound was associated with a variety of conceptually relevant variables (e.g., intuitive cognitive style, supernatural belief). Parallel associations were less evident among profundity judgments for more conventionally profound (e.g., “A wet person does not fear the rain”) or mundane (e.g., “Newborn babies require constant attention”) statements. These results support the idea that some people are more receptive to this type of bullshit and that detecting it is not merely a matter of indiscriminate skepticism but rather a discernment of deceptive vagueness in otherwise impressive sounding claims. Our re- sults also suggest that a bias toward accepting statements as true may be an important component of pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity.",On the Reception and Detection of Pseudo-Profound Bullshit,0.75

Study 1, carried out in a barroom (N= 19), showed that the more alcoholic drinks customers consumed, the more attractive they thought they were. In Study 2, 94 non-student participants in a bogus taste-test study were given either an alcoholic beverage (target BAL [blood alcohol level]= 0.10 g/100 ml) or a non-alcoholic beverage, with half of each group believing they had consumed alcohol and half believing they had not (balanced placebo design). After consuming beverages, they delivered a speech and rated how attractive, bright, original, and funny they thought they were. The speeches were videotaped and rated by 22 independent judges. Results showed that participants who thought they had consumed alcohol gave themselves more positive self-evaluations. However, ratings from independent judges showed that this boost in self-evaluation was unrelated to actual performance.",Beauty is in the eye of the beer holder': people who think they are drunk also think they are attractive,1.0
20,115,"People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.",Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing Ones Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments.,0.25
21,116,"The effect of wearing different types of textiles on sexual activity was studied in 75 rats which were divided into five equal groups: four test groups and one control. Each of the four test groups were dressed in one type of textile pants made of either 100% polyester, 50/50% polyester/cotton mix, 100% cotton or 100% wool. Sexual behaviour was assessed before and after 6 and 12 months of wearing the pants and 6 months after their removal. The rate of intromission to mounting (I/M) was determined. The electrostatic potentials generated on penis and scrotum were also measured by electrostatic kilovoltameter. At 6 and 12 months of wearing the polyester and polyester-cotton mix pants, the I/M ratio was significantly reduced compared to the pre-test levels and the controls (p < 0.0001). The reduction was more manifest in the polyester than in the polyester-cotton mix group, and at the 12th month than at the 6th month of examination. The I/M ratio of the cotton and wool groups showed insignificant changes (p > 0.05) at the 6th month of the study and a significant increase at the 12th month (p < 0.01). Six months after removal of the pants, the I/M ratio returned to the pre-test levels (p > 0.05) in the four groups. The polyester-containing pants generated electrostatic potentials while the other textiles did not. These potentials seem to induce 'electrostatic fields' in the intrapenile structures, which could explain the decrease in the rats' sexual activity.",Effect of different types of textiles on sexual activity.

22,127,"Imitation is a cornerstone of human development, serving both a cognitive function (e.g. in the acquisition and transmission of skills and knowledge) and a social–communicative function, whereby the imitation of familiar actions serves to maintain social interaction and promote prosociality. In nonhuman primates, this latter function is poorly understood, or even claimed to be absent. In this observational study, we documented interactions between chimpanzees and zoo visitors and found that the two species imitated each other at a similar rate, corresponding to almost 10% of all produced actions. Imitation appeared to accomplish a social–communicative function, as cross-species interactions that contained imitative actions lasted significantly longer than interactions without imitation. In both species, physical proximity promoted cross-species imitation. Overall, imitative precision was higher among visitors than among chimpanzees, but this difference vanished in proximity contexts, i.e. in the indoor environment. Four of five chimpanzees produced imitations; three of them exhibited comparable imitation rates, despite large individual differences in level of cross-species interactivity. We also found that chimpanzees evidenced imitation recognition, yet only when visitors imitated their actions (as opposed to postures). Imitation recognition was expressed by returned imitation in 36% of the cases, and all four imitating chimpanzees engaged in so-called imitative games. Previously regarded as unique to early human socialization, such games serve to maintain social engagement. The results presented here indicate that nonhuman apes exhibit spontaneous imitation that can accomplish a communicative function. The study raises a number of novel questions for imitation research and highlights the imitation of familiar behaviours as a relevant—yet thus far understudied—research topic.

23,133,"Traffic accidents are a major cause of death and injury in the world. Generally speaking about aggression, evidence has shown that drivers who usually express aggressive behaviors more frequently tend, at the same time, to have higher rates of road crashes or traffic incidents. Furthermore, in most cases, the situations in which aggressive behaviors appear are typical of normal current traffic conditions, turning this behavior into something very common, and into a very serious road safety issue. This has also been related with the clear lack of Road Safety Education that is evident in most of the countries. The aim of this study was to describe the factors and perceptions related to the aggressive behavior of verbally insulting and shouting while driving. In this study, an extensive list of behaviors, that experts more or less unanimously consider as aggressive driving, was described; one of them was labeled shouting and insulting. The sample was obtained from a random sampling proportional to and representative of the segments of the population by age, sex, region and size of the municipality. The survey was aimed at Spanish drivers over 14 years. The starting sample size was 1,100 surveys. As a result, shouting and insulting is not considered such a dangerous offense as it is driving under the influence of alcohol, but we cannot deny that there are many types of bad or risky maneuvers that could be banned from a legal point of view. The degree of social tolerance towards such behavior is variable. Some individuals merely ignore them, accepting them as something inevitable. Multiple types of risky maneuvers and deliberated misbehaviors, which are (formally and informally) already forbidden from a legal point of view, make other drivers and pedestrians uncomfortable and restrict their movements, creating violent, stressful and risky situations, and they are still performed by drivers. In short, aggression in driving is one of them. As a conclusion, there is a high prevalence of this phenomenon among Spanish drivers. Furthermore, most of the aggressive expressions related to shouting and cursing on the road are preceded by subjective factors such as stress, fatigue and personality traits, which may be intervened through the strengthening of road safety education and road safety campaigns ","Shouting and Cursing while Driving: Frequency, Reasons, Perceived Risk and Punishment",0.0
24,137,"A word like Huh?--used as a repair initiator when, for example, one has not clearly heard what someone just said--is found in roughly the same form and function in spoken languages across the globe. We investigate it in naturally occurring conversations in ten languages and present evidence and arguments for two distinct claims: that Huh? is universal, and that it is a word. In support of the first, we show that the similarities in form and function of this interjection across languages are much greater than expected by chance. In support of the second claim we show that it is a lexical, conventionalised form that has to be learnt, unlike grunts or emotional cries. We discuss possible reasons for the cross-linguistic similarity and propose an account in terms of convergent evolution. Huh? is a universal word not because it is innate but because it is shaped by selective pressures in an interactional environment that all languages share: that of other-initiated repair. Our proposal enhances evolutionary models of language change by suggesting that conversational infrastructure can drive the convergent cultural evolution of linguistic items.","Is ""huh?"" a universal word?

25,144,"In this paper we report on a system, ""SpeechJammer"", which can be used to disturb people's speech. In general, human speech is jammed by giving back to the speakers their own utterances at a delay of a few hundred milliseconds. This effect can disturb people without any physical discomfort, and disappears immediately by stop speaking. Furthermore, this effect does not involve anyone but the speaker. We utilize this phenomenon and implemented two prototype versions by combining a direction-sensitive microphone and a direction-sensitive speaker, enabling the speech of a specific person to be disturbed. We discuss practical application scenarios of the system, such as facilitating and controlling discussions. Finally, we argue what system parameters should be examined in detail in future formal studies based on the lessons learned from our preliminary study.

A questionnaire study of sighing showed that people associate sighing mainly with negative, low-intensity and deactivated emotional states. A second study investigated self/other differences in the interpretation of sighs in four hypothetical situations, revealing that sighs in other people are primarily perceived as signs of sadness, whereas own sighs are more often believed to express a state of ""giving up"" something or somebody. In a third experimental study participants worked on difficult (insoluble) puzzles, which generated many futile solution attempts, often accompanied by sighs. It is concluded that sighs are often unintentional expressions of an activity, plan or desire that has to be discarded, creating a pause before it can be replaced by a novel initiative.

28,150,"A theoretical analysis and an experimental investigation of certain aspects of automobile driver information processing were undertaken. The theo- retical analysis was the result of an effort to avoid difficulties associated with a servomechanistic approach to the automobile driving problem. The analysis is predicated on the assumption that a driver's attention is, in general, not continuously but only intermittently directed to the road. Be- tween observations, uncertainty about both the position of his own vehicle on the road and the possible presence of other vehicles or obstacles in- creases until it exceeds a threshold. At that moment in time, the driver looks again at the road. This simple model appears to be a useful analog of the driving process. The analysis makes specific predictions about the form of the functional relationship between intervals between observations and vehicle speed. The experimental program had two goals. One was the empirical in- vestigation of the relation between amount of interruption of vision and driving speed. The other was the determination for various drivers and various roads of the values of some of the parameters in the mathematical model. This report presents the results of the theoretical and experi- mental investigation. In general, the model is a fair approximation of actual behavior and it remains for future work to determine whether this approximation is good enough to be useful for the specification of vehicle, highway, and user characteristics.",The Attentional Demand of Automobile Driving,-1.0

Two Internet surveys were administered to employees who worked 35 hr or more per week. Study 1 examined prescheduled meetings attended in a typical week (N=676), whereas Study 2 investigated prescheduled meetings attended during the current day (N=304). As proposed, the relationship between meeting time demands and JAWB was moderated by task interdependence, meeting experience quality, and accomplishment striving. However, results were somewhat dependent on the time frame of a study and the operational definition used for meeting time demands. Furthermore, perceived meeting effectiveness was found to have a strong, direct relationship with JAWB.","""Not Another Meeting!""

31,220,"Empirical studies demonstrate that individuals perceive physically attractive others to be more intelligent than physically unattractive others. While most researchers dismiss this perception as a “bias” or “stereotype,” we contend that individuals have this perception because beautiful people indeed are more intelligent. The conclusion that beautiful people are more intelligent follows from four assumptions. (1) Men who are more intelligent are more likely to attain higher status than men who are less intelligent. (2) Higher-status men are more likely to mate with more beautiful women than lower-status men. (3) Intelligence is heritable. (4) Beauty is heritable. If all four assumptions are empirically true, then the conclusion that beautiful people are more intelligent is logically true, making it a proven theorem. We present empirical evidence for each of the four assumptions. While we concentrate on the relationship between beauty and intelligence in this paper, our evolutionary psychological explanation can account for a correlation between physical attractiveness and any other heritable trait that helps men attain higher status (such as aggression and social skills).",Why beautiful people are more intelligent,-0.75
32,223,"Some individuals report problems during and after Internet sex engagement, such as missing sleep and forgetting appointments, which are associated with negative life consequences. One mechanism potentially leading to these kinds of problems is that sexual arousal during Internet sex might interfere with working memory (WM) capacity, resulting in a neglect of relevant environmental information and therefore disadvantageous decision making. In this study, 28 healthy individuals performed 4 experimental manipulations of a pictorial 4-back WM task with neutral, negative, positive, or pornographic stimuli. Participants also rated 100 pornographic pictures with respect to sexual arousal and indicated masturbation urges previous to and following pornographic picture presentation. Results revealed worse WM performance in the pornographic picture condition of the 4-back task compared with the three remaining picture conditions. Furthermore, hierarchical regression analysis indicated an explanation of variance of the sensitivity in the pornographic picture condition by the subjective rating of the pornographic pictures as well as by a moderation effect of masturbation urges. Results contribute to the view that indicators of sexual arousal due to pornographic picture processing interfere with WM performance. Findings are discussed with respect to Internet sex addiction because WM interference by addiction-related cues is well known from substance dependencies.",Pornographic Picture Processing Interferes with Working Memory Performance,-0.25
33,229,"The paper describes an experimental study on vocal emotion expression and recognition and the development of a computer agent for emotion recognition. The study deals with a corpus of 700 short utterances expressing five emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear, and normal (unemotional) state, which were portrayed by thirty subjects. The utterances were evaluated by twenty three subjects, twenty of whom participated in recording. The accuracy of recognition emotions in speech is the following: happiness - 61.4%, anger - 72.2%, sadness - 68.3%, fear - 49.5%, and normal - 66.3%. The human ability to portray emotions is approximately at the same level (happiness - 59.8%, anger - 71.7%, sadness - 68.1%, fear - 49.7%, and normal - 65.1%), but the standard deviation is much larger. The human ability to recognize their own emotions has been also evaluated. It turned out that people are good in recognition anger (98.1%), sadness (80%) and fear (78.8%), but are less confident for normal state (71.9%) and happiness (71.2%). A part of the corpus was used for extracting features and training computer based recognizers. Some statistics of the pitch, the first and second formants, energy and the speaking rate were selected and several types of recognizers were created and compared. The best results were obtained using the ensembles of neural network recognizers, which demonstrated the following accuracy: normal state - 55-75%, happiness - 60-70%, anger - 70-80%, sadness - 75-85%, and fear - 35-55%. The total average accuracy is about 70%. An emotion recognition agent was created that is able to analyze telephone quality speech signal and distinguish between two emotional states --""agitation"" and ""calm"" -- with the accuracy of 77%.

35,246,"Animals, including dogs, dolphins, monkeys and man, follow gaze. What mediates this bias towards the eyes? One hypothesis is that primates possess a distinct neural module that is uniquely tuned for the eyes of others. An alternative explanation is that configural face processing drives fixations to the middle of peoples' faces, which is where the eyes happen to be located. We distinguish between these two accounts. Observers were presented with images of people, non-human creatures with eyes in the middle of their faces (`humanoids') or creatures with eyes positioned elsewhere (`monsters'). There was a profound and significant bias towards looking early and often at the eyes of humans and humanoids and also, critically, at the eyes of monsters. These findings demonstrate that the eyes, and not the middle of the head, are being targeted by the oculomotor system.",Monsters are people too,0.75
36,256,"Although the ability to sense skin wetness and humidity is critical for behavioral and autonomic adaptations, humans are not provided with specific skin receptors for sensing wetness. It has been proposed that we “learn” to perceive the wetness experienced when the skin is in contact with a wet surface or when sweat is produced through a multisensory integration of thermal and tactile inputs generated by the interaction between skin and moisture. However, the individual roles of thermal and tactile cues and how these are integrated peripherally and centrally by our nervous system is still poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that the central integration of coldness and mechanosensation, as subserved by peripheral A-nerve afferents, might be the primary neural process underpinning human wetness sensitivity. During a quantitative sensory test, we found that individuals perceived warm-wet and neutral-wet stimuli as significantly less wet than cold-wet stimuli, although these were characterized by the same moisture content. Also, when cutaneous cold and tactile sensitivity was diminished by a selective reduction in the activity of A-nerve afferents, wetness perception was significantly reduced. Based on a concept of perceptual learning and Bayesian perceptual inference, we developed the first neurophysiological model of cutaneous wetness sensitivity centered on the multisensory integration of cold-sensitive and mechanosensitive skin afferents. Our results provide evidence for the existence of a specific information processing model that underpins the neural representation of a typical wet stimulus. These findings contribute to explaining how humans sense warm, neutral, and cold skin wetness.",Why wet feels wet? A neurophysiological model of human cutaneous wetness sensitivity,0.0
37,277,"There is indirect evidence that heightened exposure to early androgen may increase the probability that a girl will develop a homosexual orientation in adulthood. One such putative marker of early androgen exposure is the ratio of the length of the index finger (2D) to the ring finger (4D), which is smaller in male humans than in females, and is smaller in lesbians than in heterosexual women. Yet there is also evidence that women may have different sexual orientations at different times in their lives, which suggests that other influences on female sexual orientation, presumably social, are at work as well. We surveyed individuals from a gay pride street fair and found that lesbians who identified themselves as ""butch"" had a significantly smaller 2D:4D than did those who identified themselves as ""femme."" We conclude that increased early androgen exposure plays a role in only some cases of female homosexuality, and that the sexual orientation of ""femme"" lesbians is unlikely to have been influenced by early androgens.

It is based on data drawn from a large database collected through a web questionnaire on bilingualism and emotions. t -Tests revealed that the perceived emotional force of S-T words is highest in the L1 and gradually lower in languages learned subsequently. Self-reported L1 attriters were found to judge S-Twords in their L1 to be less powerful than those who are still dominant in their L1. Participants who learned their language(s) in a naturalistic or partly naturalistic context gave higher ratings on emotional force of S-T words in that language than instructed language learners. Self-rated proficiency in a language and frequency of use of language significantly predicted perception of emotional force of S-T words.

The present research is the first to examine the effects of superheroes on men's body image and the moderating role of parasocial relationship status (PSR; a one-sided psychological bond) on those effects. Men who had vs. did not have a PSR with a superhero were exposed to a muscular vs. non-muscular image of that superhero. As predicted, exposure to a muscular superhero with whom a PSR did not exist made men feel bad about their bodies (Hypothesis 1). However, having a PSR with a muscular superhero not only eliminated the negative effects of exposure on body satisfaction, but also increased men's physical strength (Hypothesis 2).

Because agreeable men disconfirm (and disagreeable men confirm) conventional gender roles, agreeableness was expected to be more negatively related to income for men (i.e., the pay gap between agreeable men and agreeable women would be smaller than the gap between disagreeable men and disagreeable women). The hypotheses were supported across 4 studies. Study 1 confirmed the effects of sex and agreeableness on income and that the agreeableness-income relationship was significantly more negative for men than for women. Study 2 replicated these results, controlling for each of the other Big Five traits. Study 3 also replicated the interaction and explored explanations and paradoxes of the relationship. A 4th study, using an experimental design, yielded evidence for the argument that the joint effects of agreeableness and gender are due to backlash against agreeable men.",Do Nice Guys-and Gals-Really Finish Last?

43,318,"Singing is a cultural universal and an important part of modern society, yet many people fail to sing in tune. Many possible causes have been posited to explain poor singing abilities; foremost among these are poor perceptual ability, poor motor control, and sensorimotor mapping errors. To help discriminate between these causes of poor singing, we conducted 5 experiments testing musicians and nonmusicians in pitch matching and judgment tasks. Experiment 1 introduces a new instrument called a slider, on which participants can match pitches without using their voice. Pitch matching on the slider can be directly compared with vocal pitch matching, and results showed that both musicians and nonmusicians were more accurate using the slider than their voices to match target pitches, arguing against a perceptual explanation of singing deficits. Experiment 2 added a self-matching condition and showed that nonmusicians were better at matching their own voice than a synthesized voice timbre, but were still not as accurate as on the slider. This suggests a timbral translation type of mapping error. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that singers do not improve over multiple sung responses, or with the aid of a visual representation of pitch. Experiment 5 showed that listeners were more accurate at perceiving the pitch of the synthesized tones than actual voice tones. The pattern of results across experiments demonstrates multiple possible causes of poor singing, and attributes most of the problem to poor motor control and timbral-translation errors, rather than a purely perceptual deficit, as other studies have suggested.

44,322,"In order to examine the relative influence of size-based expectancies and social cues on the perceived weight of objects, two studies were performed, using equally weighing dolls differing in sex-related and age-related vulnerability or physical strength cues. To increase variation in perceived size, stimulus objects were viewed through optical lenses of varying reducing power. Different groups of participants were required to provide magnitude estimates of perceived size, physical strength, or weight, or of expected weight. A size–weight illusion (SWI) was demonstrated, such that smaller objects felt heavier than larger ones, that was entirely accounted for by the mediating role of expected weight. Yet, perceived physical strength exerted an additional and more reactive influence on perceived weight independently of measured expectancies. Results are used to clarify the nature of “embodied”, internal sensory–motor representations of physical and social properties.",Why Barbie feels heavier than Ken: The influence of size-based expectancies and social cues on the illusory perception of weight,0.5

46,344,"Several turbulence models are available in the literature, and each model has its own unique features. To establish the most appropriate model for characterizing the flow field in a multiple-occupancy ventilated space; five different turbulence models are evaluated. The turbulence models studied are: (1) the standard κ−ε model, (2) the RNG κ−ε model, (3) the Low-Reynolds-Number κ−ε model, (4) the κ–ω model, and (5) the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM). Based on convergence and computational stability criteria, the RNG κ−ε model was found to be the most appropriate model that characterizes the flow field in a ventilated space occupied by ten cows positioned at random. The micro-flow field associated with each cow was used to simulate heat exchange between the animal and its environment. A coupled heat and mass transfer model was developed to simulate the heat exchange. The total heat loss from the cows varied approximately between 215 and 710 W because of variations in flow fields surrounding the animals.

48,396,"We consider two well known constructions of link invariants. One uses skein theory: you resolve each crossing of the link as a linear combination of things that don't cross, until you eventually get a linear combination of links with no crossings, which you turn into a polynomial. The other uses quantum groups: you construct a functor from a topological category to some category of representations in such a way that (directed framed) links get sent to endomorphisms of the trivial representation, which are just rational functions. Certain instances of these two constructions give rise to essentially the same invariants, but when one carefully matches them there is a minus sign that seems out of place. We discuss exactly how the constructions match up in the case of the Jones polynomial, and where the minus sign comes from. On the quantum group side, one is led to use a non-standard ribbon element, which then allows one to consider a larger topological category.",A minus sign that used to annoy me but now I know why it is there,0.75
49,398,"The issue of emotion recognition in real-life settings, lacking a clear criterion of the nature of the underlying emotion, is raised. After reporting their luggage lost, 110 airline passengers were asked to rate their emotional state (subjective feeling criterion). The agents who had processed the claims were asked to rate the passengers' emotional state (objective behavior criterion) as well as their own feelings. An excerpt of the videotaped interaction for 40 passengers was rated for emotional state by judges on the basis of (a) verbal and nonverbal cues or (b) nonverbal cues only. As predicted, the data show that judges' inferences in both exposure conditions correlate more strongly with the objective behavior (agent ratings) than the subjective feeling criterion (self-ratings). Using the Facial Action Coding System, objectively coded ""felt"" (but not false) smiles correlated positively with a good humor scale in both criteria and judges' ratings.

We measured the lengths of the 2nd (index) and 4th (ring) finger in a sample of young men and recorded short digital video clips of their dance movements. A panel of 104 female judges rated 12 clips of men with the lowest and highest finger-length ratios (2D:4D) for attractiveness, dominance, and masculinity. We found that dances by men with low (masculinised) 2D:4D ratios were rated significantly higher on attractiveness, dominance, and masculinity than dancers with high (feminised) 2D:4D. There were no significant differences between the two groups of dancers for age and other physical measures such as waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body-mass-index (BMI). Since there is evidence that finger-length ratios negatively correlate with testosterone exposure in utero, male dancing abilities may be organized early during development. Moreover, women’s ability to perceive differences in dance movement of men with low and high 2D:4D may indicate that dance provides some cues to phenotypic condition, relevant for sexual selection.",A preliminary investigation of the associations between digit ratio and women’s perception of men’s dance,-0.25

54,845,"Right seat-side preference in a cinema has been explained by suggesting that it allows for emotional information processing by the right hemisphere (Karev, 2000). In order to determine seat-side preferences, participants in our experiments had to choose seats on cinema, theatre, and restaurant maps. The maps varied with respect to cinema screen, theatre stage, and restaurant entrance positions as viewed by the participants: on top, to the right, to the left, and at the bottom. Seat-side preference was found to be modified by the map's arrangement: With screen, stage, or entrance on top, participants preferred seats to the right of the screen, stage, or entrance, while for the other positions the results were not conclusive. Based on these results it cannot be concluded that the preference for a cinema seat is solely mediated by the preparation for an upcoming event to optimise emotional processing by the right hemisphere. Rather, seat choice seems to be determined by basic behavioural tendencies, such as which side to turn to when entering a room, or by visual attentional orientation.",How to Choose a Seat in Theatres: Always Sit on the Right Side?,-0.5

In contrast, neglected children were perceived in less distinctive reputational terms but, unlike rejected children, were notable for perceiving peers differently. Older children were more likely than younger children to describe the reputations of their peers with complex trait concepts. Sex differences included the following: rejected boys were perceived as having characteristics polar opposite to accepted qualities for girls, whereas rejected girls were perceived as having characteristics polar opposite to acceptable qualities for boys.

Participants were presented with videos of 8- to 16-year-olds telling either the truth or a lie about having peeked at the answers to a test and were asked to evaluate the veracity of the statement along with their confidence in their judgment. All groups performed at chance in the accuracy of their veracity judgments. Furthermore, although all groups tended to hold a truth bias for 8- to 16-year-olds, the parent–own group held a much stronger truth bias than the other two groups. All groups were also highly confident in their judgments (70%–76%), but confidence ratings failed to predict accuracy. These findings, taken together, suggest that the close relationship that parents share with their own children may be related to a bias toward believing their children’s statements and, hence, a failure to detect their lies.","Can parents detect 8- to 16-year-olds' lies?

The recent fashion of body piercing among adults has encouraged children to have similar procedures or imitate them by applying small magnets to sustain the jewellery used in piercing in position. This paper describes a series of 24 cases presented to the Sheffield Children's Hospital over a period of eight weeks. The children imitated body piercing by using small powerful magnets across parts of their body including nose, ears, penis, and tongue. Some swallowed the magnets while attempting to use them, resulting in one near fatal surgical complication.

66,928,"Para-social behavior is a form of quasi-interpersonal behavior that results when audience members develop bonds with media personalities that can resemble interpersonal social interaction, but is not usually applied to political communication. This study tested whether the ""Drinking-Buddy"" Scale, a simple question frequently used in political communication, could be interpreted as a single-item measure of para-social behavior with respect to political candidates in terms of image judgments related to interpersonal attraction and perceived similarity to self. The participants were college students who had voted in the 2008 election. They rated the candidates, Obama or McCain, as drinking buddies and then rated the candidates' perceived similarity to themselves in attitude and background, and also the social and task attraction to the candidate. If the drinking-buddy rating serves as a proxy measure for para-social behavior, then it was expected that participants' ratings for all four kinds of similarity to and attraction toward a candidate would be higher for the candidate they chose as a drinking buddy. The directional hypotheses were supported for interpersonal attraction, but not for perceived similarity. These results indicate that the drinking-buddy scale predicts ratings of interpersonal attraction, while voters may view perceived similarity as an important but not essential factor in their candidate preference.","The ""drinking-buddy"" scale as a measure of para-social behavior.",0.5
67,935,"Carrying food to water and either dunking or manipulating it before consumption has been observed in various taxa including birds, racoons and primates. Some animals seem to be simply moistening their food. However, true washing aims to remove unpleasant surface substrates such as grit and sand and requires a distinction between items that do and do not need cleaning as well as deliberate transportation of food to a water source. We provide the first evidence for food washing in suids, based on an incidental observation with follow-up experiments on European wild boar (Sus scrofa) kept at Basel Zoo, Switzerland. Here, all adult pigs and some juveniles of a newly formed group carried apple halves soiled with sand to the edge of a creek running through their enclosure where they put the fruits in the water and pushed them to and fro with their snouts before eating. Clean apple halves were never washed. This indicates that pigs can discriminate between soiled and unsoiled foods and that they are able to delay gratification for long enough to transport and wash the items. However, we were unable to ascertain to which degree individual and/or social learning brought this behaviour about.",Not eating like a pig: European wild boar wash their food,0.75

Responding to the call for an increased historical narrative in accounting, we have studied the literature, documentation and personal memoirs concerning circus in Australia. From our examination, we have abstracted and analysed material that expresses, or implies, the use of accounting information. Themes identified include the magnitude and nature of capital investments; ticket pricing and revenues; the nature and composition of operational costs; standards of internal control; insolvencies and liquidations. We have established that, despite elementary levels of education, many circus people exhibited an intuitive grasp of fundamental accounting principles, albeit in a rudimentary form. Nevertheless, since financial and management reporting practises were typically unsystematic, and even non-existent, in all but the largest circus enterprises, Australian circus management may not have been optimized.",Juggling the Books: The Use of Accounting Information in Circus in Australia,0.5

We investigate it in naturally occurring conversations in ten languages and present evidence and arguments for two distinct claims: that Huh? is universal, and that it is a word. In support of the first, we show that the similarities in form and function of this interjection across languages are much greater than expected by chance. In support of the second claim we show that it is a lexical, conventionalised form that has to be learnt, unlike grunts or emotional cries. We discuss possible reasons for the cross-linguistic similarity and propose an account in terms of convergent evolution. Huh? is a universal word not because it is innate but because it is shaped by selective pressures in an interactional environment that all languages share: that of other-initiated repair.

Consequently, we model a zombie attack, using biological assumptions based on popular zombie movies. We introduce a basic model for zombie infection, determine equilibria and their stability, and illustrate the outcome with numerical solutions. We then refine the model to introduce a latent period of zombification, whereby humans are infected, but not infectious, before becoming undead. We then modify the model to include the effects of possible quarantine or a cure.  Finally, we examine the impact of regular, impulsive reductions in the number of zombies and derive conditions under which eradication can occur.

This model was constructed by the following five effects: (1) behavior of the entire crowd (measured by troop length in this study), (2) repulsive and attractive forces operating directly between two individuals (direct effect), (3) effect of third individual on distance between two given individuals (half-indirect effect), (4) effects of unconnected pairs on the distance between two given individuals (indirect effect), and (5) residual effect which cannot be explained by the above four effects to determine distances between individuals (random/involuntary movement effect). These effects were analyzed using simple and multiple regression equations. Whole data taken every 5 min were divided into two phases: a grazing phase and a resting phase.  The distances between two individuals in the grazing phase were much greater than the distances in the resting phase. The temporal variation of distances between two individuals in the grazing phase was much larger than the variation of distances in the resting phase.

82,1068,"The metabolic cost associated with locomotion represents a significant part of an animal's metabolic energy budget. Therefore understanding the ways in which animals manage the energy required for locomotion by controlling muscular effort is critical to understanding limb design and the evolution of locomotor behavior. The assumption that energetic economy is the most important target of natural selection underlies many analyses of steady animal locomotion, leading to the prediction that animals will choose gaits and postures that maximize energetic efficiency. Many quadrupedal animals, particularly those that specialize in long distance steady locomotion, do in fact reduce the muscular contribution required for walking by adopting pendulum-like center of mass movements that facilitate exchange between kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE) [1]–[4]. However, animals that are not specialized for long distance steady locomotion may face a more complex set of requirements, some of which may conflict with the efficient exchange of mechanical energy. For example, the “stealthy” walking style of cats may demand slow movements performed with the center of mass close to the ground. Force plate and video data show that domestic cats (Felis catus, Linnaeus, 1758) have lower mechanical energy recovery than mammals specialized for distance. A strong negative correlation was found between mechanical energy recovery and diagonality in the footfalls and there was also a negative correlation between limb compression and diagonality of footfalls such that more crouched postures tended to have greater diagonality. These data show a previously unrecognized mechanical relationship in which crouched postures are associated with changes in footfall pattern which are in turn related to reduced mechanical energy recovery. Low energy recovery was not associated with decreased vertical oscillations of the center of mass as theoretically predicted, but rather with posture and footfall pattern on the phase relationship between potential and kinetic energy. An important implication of these results is the possibility of a tradeoff between stealthy walking and economy of locomotion. This potential tradeoff highlights the complex and conflicting pressures that may govern the locomotor choices that animals make.",Whole Body Mechanics of Stealthy Walking in Cats.,-0.25

The idealization reduces the bottle to a cylinder of diameter $D_{0}$, length $L$, closed at the top and open at the bottom through a circular thin-walled hole of diameter $d$, on the axis of the cylinder. The study is performed in the low-viscosity limit. The oscillatory emptying of the ‘bottle’ is referred to as the glug-glug, and is characterized by its period $T$, whereas the whole emptying process is characterized by a time $T_{e}$. Concerning the long time scale $T_{e}$, we show that: \[ \frac{T_{e}}{T_{e0}}=\left(\frac{D_{0}}{d}\right)^{5/2}, \] where $T_{e0}\,{\approx}\, 3.0 L/\sqrt{gD_{0}}$ is the emptying time of an unrestricted cylinder. On the short time scale $T$, we show that the physical origin of the oscillations lies in the compressibility of the surrounding gas. The period can be written as: \[ T\,{=}\,\frac{L}{\sqrt{\gamma P_{0}/\rho}}\Phi(\skew1\bar{z}_{i}/L), \] where $\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas, $P_{0}$ its pressure and $\rho$ stands for the density of the liquid. The function $\Phi$ is dimensionless and changes with the relative position of the liquid interface $\skew1\bar{z}_{i}/L$.

89,1170,"A classical question in philosophy and psychology is if the sense of one's body influences how one visually perceives the world. Several theoreticians have suggested that our own body serves as a fundamental reference in visual perception of sizes and distances, although compelling experimental evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. In contrast, modern textbooks typically explain the perception of object size and distance by the combination of information from different visual cues. Here, we describe full body illusions in which subjects experience the ownership of a doll's body (80 cm or 30 cm) and a giant's body (400 cm) and use these as tools to demonstrate that the size of one's sensed own body directly influences the perception of object size and distance. These effects were quantified in ten separate experiments with complementary verbal, questionnaire, manual, walking, and physiological measures. When participants experienced the tiny body as their own, they perceived objects to be larger and farther away, and when they experienced the large-body illusion, they perceived objects to be smaller and nearer. Importantly, despite identical retinal input, this “body size effect” was greater when the participants experienced a sense of ownership of the artificial bodies compared to a control condition in which ownership was disrupted. These findings are fundamentally important as they suggest a causal relationship between the representations of body space and external space. Thus, our own body size affects how we perceive the world.",Being Barbie: the size of one's own body determines the perceived size of the world,0.0

While incidents have occurred since 1985, their recent escalation in size, frequency, and property damages continues to raise public concern in many college and university towns across North America. Research indicates that celebratory riots result from large non-protest related assemblies of mostly students where alcohol is consumed freely, participants spontaneously engage in unruly behaviour, and police intervention invites resistant and aggressive responses from crowd members. However, such outbursts are often difficult to predict since they may emerge from a myriad of possible trigger events. In order to further interpret celebratory rioting, this thesis examines a number of individual-centred and event-centred crowd theories to determine what is known about crowd behaviour. This study concludes that the analysis of a celebratory riot event requires a process-rooted approach, such as the Value-Added model, to account for the situational factors which shape the event’s precursors, transactions and aftermath.  This thesis focuses analytical attention on the annual Queen’s Homecoming Aberdeen street party in Kingston, Ontario which became riotous in 2005. This case study comprised an extensive media content analysis, Queen’s archival research, and direct observation at a number of student focus groups, committee meetings and student gatherings. This ii study, which concludes with an analysis of the non-riotous Homecoming celebrations of 2006, revealed that the riot of 2005 was hardly unique; instead, it followed decades of intermittent student disturbances in the Queen’s student neighbourhood. Furthermore, the 2005 Aberdeen Street riot ultimately parallels the story of so many celebratory riots which have recently occurred and continue to emerge in a number of college and university towns across North America.

103,1419,"The Star Wars Scroll Illusion is a dynamic version of the Leaning Tower Illusion. When two copies of a Star-Wars-like scrolling text are placed side by side (with separate vanishing points), the two scrolls appear to head in different directions even though they are physically parallel in the picture plane. Variations of the illusion are shown with one vanishing point, as well as from an inverted perspective where the scrolls appear to originate in the distance. The demos highlight the conflict between the physical lines in the picture plane and perspective interpretation: With two perspective points, the scrolling texts are parallel to each other in the picture plane but not in perspective interpretation; with one perspective point, the texts are not parallel to each other in the picture plane but are parallel to each other in perspective interpretation. The size of the effect is linearly related to the angle of rotation of the scrolls into the third dimension; the Scroll Illusion is stronger than the Leaning Tower Illusion for rotation angles between 35° and 90°. There is no effect of motion per se on the strength of the illusion.",The Star Wars Scroll Illusion,-0.25
104,1425,"The detection and appreciation of humor is a complex cognitive process that remains poorly understood. Although functional neuroimaging studies have begun to map the brain systems involved in humor appreciation, there are virtually no data on the structural correlates between gray matter volume and this capacity. Using voxel-based morphometry, the present study examined the association between gray matter volume and the ability to detect and appreciate humor. Fifty-nine healthy adults aged 18-45 years (30 men) underwent structural MRI and completed the University of Pennsylvania Humor Appreciation Test (HAT). After controlling for age and sex, gray matter volume of the left inferior frontal gyrus, left temporal pole, and left insula correlated positively with the appreciation of visual and verbal humor on the HAT, whereas the gray matter volume of the right inferior frontal gyrus correlated only with verbal humor appreciation scores. There were no negative correlations between gray matter volume and HAT performance. These data support a neurobiological basis for humor appreciation, particularly involving left-hemispheric cortical systems, and further suggest that individual differences in humor appreciation may be related to differences in regional gray matter volume.",A funny thing happened on the way to the scanner: humor detection correlates with gray matter volume,0.5
105,1426,"Disgust is a powerful behavioral adaptation, which confers the advantage of reducing the risk of pathogen infection. However, there are situations in which disgust at core elicitors (e.g., feces) must be modulated in the service of other goals (e.g., caring for a close kin). In Study 1, mothers of infants completed a self-report questionnaire about their reactions to changing their baby's feces-soiled diaper compared with the diaper of someone else's baby. In Study 2, mothers of infants were presented with a series of trials in which they smelled concealed samples of their own baby's feces-soiled diaper and those of someone else's baby. In addition, labels were used to identify the source of the sample (correctly labeled, mislabeled, or no label). Both studies provide evidence suggesting that mothers regard their own baby's fecal smell as less disgusting than that from someone else's baby. Furthermore, labeling had relatively little influence on this effect, and the effect persisted when social desirability was controlled.",My Baby Doesn't Smell as Bad as Yours: The Plasticity of Disgust,0.75

The first uncovered dialogue patterns of ATM users for the purpose of designing the user interface for a simulated speech ATM system. Applying the Wizard-of-Oz methodology, multiple mapping and word spotting techniques, the speech driven ATM accommodates bilingual users of Bahasa Melayu and English. The second experiment evaluates the usability of a hybrid speech ATM, comparing it with a simulated manual ATM. The aim is to investigate how natural and fun can talking to a speech ATM be for these first-time users. Subjects performed the withdrawal and balance enquiry tasks. The ANOVA was performed on the usability and affective data. The results showed significant differences between systems in the ability to complete the tasks as well as in transaction errors. Performance was measured on the time taken by subjects to complete the task and the number of speech recognition errors that occurred. On the basis of user emotions, it can be said that the hybrid speech system enabled pleasurable interaction. Despite the limitations of speech recognition technology, users are set to talk to the ATM when it becomes available for public use.",Is talking to an automated teller machine natural and fun?,-0.5
107,1457,"Whilst computer-mediated communication (CMC) can benefit users by providing quick and easy communication between those separated by time and space, it can also provide varying degrees of anonymity that may encourage a sense of impunity and freedom from being held accountable for inappropriate online behaviour. As such, CMC is a fertile ground for studying impoliteness, whether it occurs in response to perceived threat (flaming), or as an end in its own right (trolling). Currently, first and second-order definitions of terms such as im/politeness (Brown and Levinson 1987; Bousfield 2008; Culpeper 2008; Terkourafi 2008), in-civility (Lakoff 2005), rudeness (Beebe 1995, Kienpointner 1997, 2008), and etiquette (Coulmas 1992), are subject to much discussion and debate, yet the CMC phenomenon of trolling is not adequately captured by any of these terms.  Following Bousfield (in press), Culpeper (2010) and others, this paper suggests that a definition of trolling should be informed first and foremost by user discussions. Taking examples from a 172-million-word, asynchronous CMC corpus, four interrelated conditions of aggression, deception, disruption, and success are discussed.

Despite empirical support for the assumption that object size can serve as a metric in the perception of passing distance, the present series of experiments reveals that in catching a ball subjects do not rely on such ""point-predictive"" information. The angle at which (real and simulated) balls approached the subject systematically affected verbal and manual estimates of future passing distance, as well as the kinematic characteristics of catching movements. To catch a ball, the actor uses momentary action-related information instead of spatiotemporal estimates. The hand velocity is geared to information specifying the currently required velocity.

The highest flow rate was elicited by citric acid followed by Parafilm and odor, while the lowest flow rate was unstimulated. In order to investigate whether and how the amount of saliva a subject produces influences the sensory ratings, the four types of salivary flow rates were correlated with sensory ratings of three different types of vanilla custard dessert. No significant correlation could be found between any of the salivary flow rates and the sensory ratings. A subject with a larger saliva flow rate during eating did not rate the foods differently from a subject with less saliva flow. The same pattern was seen for all types of stimulation.

Participants completed a questionnaire designed to assess whether they considered themselves to be sport fans, their sport fan behavior, and their reasons for considering themselves a sport fan. The results show that an equal number of males and females considered themselves to be sport fans, although males identified more strongly with being a fan than females. Males also engaged in more sport fan behavior than females, with the exception of attending sporting events.

The results derive from controlled experiments with a number of human subjects rather than forensic casework. Standardized collection procedures were observed, situational variables were tracked. Participants (forensic laboratory employees and their spouses) were six Caucasian couples who collected their pubic hair combings immediately following intercourse. Subjects provided informed consent in accordance with the protocol for human subjects approved by the U.A.B. institutional review board. The experiment was replicated ten times for five couples, and five times for another couple (total n = 110). Transfer frequencies were calculated from instances where foreign (exogenous) hairs were observed. Results showed at least one exogenous pubic hair in 17.3% (19/110) of combings. Transfers to males (23.6%, or 13/55) were more prevalent than transfers to females (10.9%, or 6/55). Only once were transfers observed simultaneously between both male and female. A total of 28 exogenous pubic hairs were identified. Subjects reported intercourse duration of 2-25 min, intervening intervals of 1-240 h, pre-coital bathing intervals of 0.25-24 h, and predominantly missionary position (76%). No clear relationship among these other survey variables was observed. The prevalence of female-to-male pubic hair transfers suggests the importance of collecting pubic hair combings from the male suspects as well as from female victims, provided the time interval is not extreme. Even under these optimum collection conditions, pubic hair transfers were observed only 17.3% of the time.",Frequency of Pubic Hair Transfer During Sexual Intercourse.,0.5

We first validate signature size as a measure of narcissism but not overconfidence using two laboratory studies, and also find that our measure is correlated with employee perceptions of CEO narcissism used in prior research. We then use CEO signatures to study the relation between CEO narcissism, the firm’s investment policies, and firm performance. CEO narcissism is associated with overinvestment, particularly in the form of R&D and M&A expenditures, but not capital expenditures. Firms led by narcissistic CEOs experience lower financial productivity in the form of profitability and operating cash flows.

Target patients made more advantageous decisions and ultimately earned more money from their investments than the normal participants and control patients. When normal participants and control patients either won or lost money on an investment round, they adopted a conservative strategy and became more reluctant to invest on the subsequent round; these results suggest that they were more affected than target patients by the outcomes of decisions made in the previous rounds.",Investment Behavior and the Negative Side of Emotion.,-0.5
114,1658,"This study aimed to investigate how singing while driving affects driver performance. Twenty-one participants completed three trials of a simulated drive concurrently while performing a peripheral detection task (PDT); each trial was conducted either without music, with participants listening to music, or with participants singing along to music. It was hypothesised that driving performance and PDT response times would be impaired, and that driver subjective workload ratings would be higher, when participants were singing to music compared to when there was no music or when participants were listening to music. As expected, singing while driving was rated as more mentally demanding, and resulted in slower and more variable speeds, than driving without music. Listening to music was associated with the slowest speeds overall, and fewer lane excursions than the no music condition. Interestingly, both music conditions were associated with slower speed-adjusted PDT response times and significantly less deviation within the lane than was driving without music. Collectively, results suggest that singing while driving alters driving performance and impairs hazard perception while at the same time increasing subjective mental workload. However, singing while driving does not appear to affect driving performance more than simply listening to music. Further, drivers’ efforts to compensate for the increased mental workload associated with singing and listening to music by slowing down appear to be insufficient, as evidenced by relative increases in PDT response times in these two conditions compared to baseline.",A simulator study of the effects of singing on driving performance.,-0.5

Structural equation models showed that general and verbal intelligence both predict humor production ability, which in turn predicts mating success, such as lifetime number of sexual partners. Also, males showed higher average humor production ability.

Our objective was to test whether the magnitude of AM influence on gs is related to environmental conditions: irradiance, air temperature or leaf temperature. Stomatal conductances of two groups of uncolonized sorghum plants were compared to gs of plants colonized by Glomus intraradices (Gi) or Gigaspora margarita (Gm) in 31 morning and afternoon periods under naturally varying greenhouse conditions. Stomatal conductance of Gi and Gm plants was often markedly higher than gs of similarly sized nonAM plants. AM promotion of gs was minimal at the lowest irradiances and lowest air and leaf temperatures, but was substantial at intermediate irradiance and temperatures. AM promotion was again low or absent at the highest irradiances and temperatures. Magnitude of AM promotion of gs was not a function of absolute gs. Promotion of gs by Gi and Gm was remarkably similar.

120,1776,"Lipids are involved in a host of biochemical and physiological processes in corals. Therefore, changes in lipid composition reflect changes in the ecology, nutrition, and health of corals. As such, accurate lipid extraction, quantification, and identification is critical to obtain comprehensive insight into a coral's condition. However, discrepancies exist in sample preparation methodology globally, and it is currently unknown whether these techniques generate analogous results. This study compared the two most common sample preparation techniques for lipid analysis in corals: (1) tissue isolation by air-spraying and (2) crushing the coral in toto. Samples derived from each preparation technique were subsequently analysed to quantify lipids and their constituent classes and fatty acids in four common, scleractinian coral species representing three distinct morphotypes (Acropora millepora, Montipora crassotuberculata, Porites cylindrica, and Pocillopora damicornis). Results revealed substantial amounts of organic material, including lipids, retained in the skeletons of all species following air-spraying, causing a marked underestimation of total lipid concentration using this method. Moreover, lipid class and fatty acid compositions between the denuded skeleton and sprayed tissue were substantially different. In particular, the majority of the total triacylglycerol and total fatty acid concentrations were retained in the skeleton (55-69% and 56-64%, respectively). As such, the isolated, sprayed tissue cannot serve as a reliable proxy for lipid quantification or identification in the coral holobiont. The in toto crushing method is therefore recommended for coral sample preparation prior to lipid analysis to capture the lipid profile of the entire holobiont, permitting accurate diagnoses of coral condition.",A comparison of two common sample preparation techniques for lipid and fatty acid analysis in three different coral morphotypes reveals quantitative and qualitative differences,-1.0
121,1783,"We asked how shade tree admixture affects cacao water use in agroforests. In Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, cacao and shade tree sap flux was monitored in a monoculture, in a stand with admixed Gliricidia trees and in a mixture with a multi-species tree assemblage, with both mixtures having similar canopy openness. A Jarvis type sap flux model suggested a distinct difference in sap flux response to changes in vapor pressure deficit and radiation among cacao trees in the individual cultivation systems. We argue that differences originate from stomatal control of transpiration in the monoculture and altered radiation conditions and a different degree of uncoupling of the VPD from the bulk atmosphere inside shaded stands. Probably due to high sap flux variability among trees, these differences however did not result in significantly altered average daily cacao water use rates which were 16 L day−1 in the multi-species assemblage and 22 L day−1 in the other plots. In shaded stands, water use of single cacao trees increased with decreasing canopy gap fraction in the overstory since shading enhanced vegetative growth of cacao fostering transpiration per unit ground area. Estimated transpiration rates of the cacao tree layer were further controlled by stem density and amounted to 1.2 mm day−1 in the monoculture, 2.2 mm day−1 for cacao in the cacao/Gliricidia stand, and 1.1 mm day−1 in the cacao/multi-species stand. The additional transpiration by the shade trees is estimated at 0.5 mm day−1 for the Gliricidia and 1 mm day−1 for the mixed-species cultivation system.",Cacao trees under different shade tree shelter: effects on water use,-1.0
122,1811,"The distribution and abundance of phytoplankton within a sampling grid of 50×103 km2 around Elephant Island were determined from early January to mid-March of 4 successive years, 1990–1993. The number of stations where physical-optical-biological data were obtained from the surface to a maximum of 750 m ranged from 74 in 1990 to 206 in 1993. Contour maps of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations showed marked mesoscale patchiness that varied from month to month and also interannually. The distribution patterns for chl-a were similar when plotting surface concentrations or integrated values to 100 m. Three major zones could be distinguished that differed in both physical and biological characteristics. Stations in the northwest portion of the grid (Drake Passage waters) and in the southeast portion of the grid (Bransfield Strait waters) showed the most pronounced interannual variations, with phytoplankton biomass and rates of primary production being considerably higher in 1990–91 than in 1992–93. The central portion of the sampling grid, which included the major frontal system north of Elephant Island, showed the smallest interannual variations in both biological and physical parameters and the highest rates of primary production. Phytoplankton biomass and rates of primary production were correlated with depth of the upper mixed layer (UML), which in turn was correlated with the measured wind stress. The mean depth of the UML was 50 m, while the mean depth of the euphotic zone was 90 m. Using the measured mean surface solar irradiance (550 μEinsteins m−2 s−1), the mean irradiance experienced by cells in the UML of 50 m would be around 105 μE m−2 s−1, which is similar to the measured Ik (light saturation) value for photosynthesis (101 μEm−2 s−1).

123,1841,"Sexual selection is the outcome of behavioural interactions within and between the sexes. Numerous studies show how individuals modify their sexual behaviour in response to ecological or social conditions, and such changes may therefore affect the evolutionary outcome of sexual selection. Our study examined the effect of habitat structure on the sexual behaviour of male and female guppies, Poecilia reticulata. We asked whether the ability of males to observe other courting males would affect the rates of male courtship and courtship interference and the sexual responsiveness of females. Specifically, we manipulated visibility using opaque barriers in laboratory aquaria and found that there was less male interference behaviour in aquaria containing visual obstructions than in aquaria without barriers, regardless of whether the male was courting sexually responsive (virgin) or unresponsive (nonvirgin) females. In addition, sexual responsiveness of virgin females to male displays was significantly increased in aquaria with barriers relative to aquaria without barriers. Finally, the display frequency of males courting virgin females was significantly reduced in aquaria with barriers, probably as a result of the females' increased rate of sexual response. Evidently, the barriers impede visibility enough that males are less likely to observe and interfere with the courtship of other males, and therefore, females are less likely to flee or lose interest in a courting male. Ultimately, characteristics of the visual environment could affect females' ability to choose mates and in turn could potentially affect the evolutionary outcome of sexual selection.",The effect of visual obstructions on the sexual behaviour of guppies: the importance of privacy,0.25
124,1850,"The change in the composition of atmospheric deposition as it passes through the forest canopy on two 10-year-old Pinus radiata D. Don forests (Manzanal and Posadero) was studied in the Basque Country, analysing the concentration of different constituents in bulk precipitation and throughfall. The precipitation at the study sites was bimodal with two maxima in the year; one in late spring and another one in late autumn. Posadero had a mean annual precipitation of 1223.6 mm with an interception loss of 27.5% by the forest canopy and Manzanal had a mean annual precipitation of 978.6 mm with the interception loss being 22.2% of it. Constituent concentrations followed a similar seasonal variation, increasing during the summer when precipitation decreases. At both study sites the chemical species analysed in bulk precipitation and throughfall were characterised by the fact that they came from three distinct sources: acidic pollution, marine and terrestrial origin. Concentration of constituents in bulk precipitation in Manzanal was higher than in Posadero, most probably due to the smaller amount of precipitation that falls in this study site. The precipitation at Manzanal had a significantly lower pH than at Posadero. The amounts of sulphate, nitrate-nitrogen, organic nitrogen and protons that fell in the bulk precipitation at Manzanal (the polluted site) were higher than those that fell at Posadero (less polluted site). The concentration of organic nitrogen in the bulk precipitation of the polluted site was significantly related to the hydrocarbon concentration measured in the atmosphere in the nearby town of Muskiz. Throughfall in Manzanal had higher amounts of sulphate, nitrate-nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride than in Posadero. This fact suggests that both dry deposition and canopy leaching were an important source of throughfall constituents in Manzanal. The amount of manganese measured in Posadero throughfall was higher than that found in Manzanal throughfall. The pH in the throughfall did not show any significant difference between sites and was significantly higher than in bulk precipitation. Thus, canopies in the study sites seem to be able to neutralise very efficiently the acidic load of bulk deposition. Despite this buffering capacity of the canopies, the soil at Manzanal appeared to be more acidic than at Posadero, probably due to the liberation of protons in the rhizosphere when the neutralising pacity of the canopy is `recharged'. This soil acidification may be leading to a greater solubilization of aluminium in the polluted site which could suffer from cation nutrient deficiencies in the future.",Buffering capacity through cation leaching of Pinus radiata D.

We explore these issues using the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, a native of Europe that has naturalized in North America, which we planted in a common garden field plot in Knoxville, Tennessee and observed across two biotic gradients. We found evidence that directional selection favors increased plant size, consistent with hypotheses of plant responses to novel environments. However, selection differed among plants with fungus gnat larvae damage, aphid damage, and plants that escaped herbivory, evidence that the selective landscape is variable and complex even for quasi-natural field plots. We did not uncover evidence for resistance; however, our results suggest that tolerance of A. thaliana may play an important role for population establishment and persistence in the presence of herbivores in a novel environment. Our findings highlight the variation in one segment of the biotic selective landscape of field environments, as well as the importance of biotic interactions in shaping the success of recently established populations that may be a critical component of post-invasion evolution.",Relationships Between Vegetative and Life History Traits and Fitness in a Novel Field Environment: Impacts of Herbivores,-1.0

127,1949,"The optimization of real scalar functions of quaternion variables, such as the mean square error or array output power, underpins many practical applications. Solutions typically require the calculation of the gradient and Hessian. However, real functions of quaternion variables are essentially nonanalytic, which are prohibitive to the development of quaternion-valued learning systems. To address this issue, we propose new definitions of quaternion gradient and Hessian, based on the novel generalized Hamilton-real (GHR) calculus, thus making a possible efficient derivation of general optimization algorithms directly in the quaternion field, rather than using the isomorphism with the real domain, as is current practice. In addition, unlike the existing quaternion gradients, the GHR calculus allows for the product and chain rule, and for a one-to-one correspondence of the novel quaternion gradient and Hessian with their real counterparts. Properties of the quaternion gradient and Hessian relevant to numerical applications are also introduced, opening a new avenue of research in quaternion optimization and greatly simplified the derivations of learning algorithms. The proposed GHR calculus is shown to yield the same generic algorithm forms as the corresponding real- and complex-valued algorithms. Advantages of the proposed framework are illuminated over illustrative simulations in quaternion signal processing and neural networks.","Optimization in Quaternion Dynamic Systems: Gradient, Hessian, and Learning Algorithms",-1.0
128,1951,"In this paper, we propose a new approach to the analysis and modeling of esophageal manometry (EGM) data to assist the diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders in humans.

Specifically, WD is applied to the filtering of the EGM data, which is contaminated with electrocardiography (ECG) artifacts. A new NPDT is applied to the denoised data leading to identification and extraction of diagnostically important information, i.e., esophageal pulses from the respiration artifacts. Such information is used to generate a statistical model that can classify the EGM patterns. The proposed approach is computationally effortless, thus making it suitable for real-time application.

To answer this question, we analyze the outage and (average) decoding-delay for both joint and sequential sliding window decoding. For comparison, we also analyze decoding delay of backward decoding and consider its existing outage analysis. In our analysis, we consider a block fading channel with full channel state information (CSI) availability at receivers and with limited CSI at transmitters and outage events at both relay and destination and channel variation over different blocks in sliding window decoding. Moreover, by analyzing the asymptotic performance at high SNR, we prove that both joint and sequential decoding achieve a full diversity order of two and derive the coding gain gaps between backward decoding and joint and sequential sliding window decoding. To see the benefits of full-duplex relaying, we also include the performance of half-duplex schemes and conclude that the preferred scheme depends on the rate, outage, and delay requirements for a specific service.",Decoding Delay and Outage Performance Analysis of Full-Duplex Decode-Forward Relaying: Backward or Sliding Window Decoding,-1.0

The conventional read method and/or a newly proposed read method can be used to identify the charge- storage state of each bit in the cell. The new read method allows the state of each bit to be determined by a forward read operation, and it is compatible with a gate-overlapped source/drain structure that offers improved ON-state conductance in contrast to the conventional read method.

131,1958,"A new method for generation of nonhomogeneous, anisotropic random patterns defined on a square lattice is presented. First a hierarchy of seed structures is derived by recursively deleting the sites of the square lattice. This decimation process is parallel, and employs local ordering of i.i.d. random numbers. At every level of the hierarchy the surviving seeds expand and incorporate the decimated sites into cells. The ensemble of cells down-projected onto the square lattice defines a random tessellation whose coarseness increases with the level in the hierarchy. Nonhomogeneous random patterns are obtained by concatenating cells taken from different levels; anisotropic patterns by employing unequal weights in the generation process. The underlying hierarchical structure assures that the random patterns are synthesised in O[log(image_size)]time.",A fast parallel method for synthesis of random patterns,-1.0

133,1962,"This paper proposes an efficient power flow sharing and voltage regulation control method based on hierarchical control to minimize the transmission loss of dc microgrids. Different from the conventional optimal power flow algorithm for the dc grids, the proposed approach needs neither prior knowledge of the grid's conductance matrix nor the load distribution matrix, which means improvement of the expansibility and reduction of the cost. At the primary control level, a voltage droop characteristic is set for each converter to improve the stability and reliability of the grid. The secondary control level aims to regulate the power flow of the microgrid to the optimal condition. The two control levels exchange information by low bandwidth communication. The validity of the proposed approach is verified by both simulation results of a dc microgrid based on IEEE 14-bus system and experimental results on a 50-V two-terminal prototype dc microgrid.",Transmission Loss Optimization-Based Optimal Power Flow Strategy by Hierarchical Control for DC Microgrids,-1.0

Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with coordinated multiple points (CoMP) are wildly approved as a promising solution to meet increasing demands of mobile data traffic and to reduce energy consumptions. However, hyper-dense deployments and complex coordination mechanisms introduce several challenges in radio resource management (RRM) of mobile communication systems. To address this issue, we present an RRM approach for CoMP-based HetNets, which aims to maximize weighted energy efficiency while guaranteeing the data rate of each transmission. The proposed RRM approach is based on a cross-entropy (CE) optimization method that is an effective and low-complexity heuristic algorithm.

136,1972,A new approach to estimating motion of a highly maneuverable aircraft target in an air-to-air tracking scenario is presented. An interactive filter system is developed that provides an improved estimate of target motion states by conditioning kinematic filter estimates on target aspect angle data. Pattern recognition techniques used with an electrooptical tracker are presumed to provide this target aspect information. A target orientation filter processes the aspect angle measurements by statistically weighting measured aspect angles with the current best estimate of target kinematics. The aerodynamic lift equation is used to relate approximate angle of attack to target velocity and acceleration. A novel statistical model for aircraft target normal acceleration is also developed to represent better the unknown target accelerations.

Based on the determined target rate, we obtain the transmit power of the HeNBs in a closed form by using an approximation with an assumption of a high signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR).

The proposed method is based on the first-order statistics, in which there is no need to estimate the scatter matrices. Thus, the presented method not only can avoid the singularity problem in small sample size situations but also can achieve high performance in such situations. In addition, due to the fact that the proposed algorithm only exploits the first order statistical moments, it is very fast making it suitable for real-time hyperspectral scene analysis. The proposed method makes a matrix whose columns are obtained by averaging training samples of different classes. Then, a new transform is used to map the features from the original space into a new low-dimensional space such that the new features are as different from each other as possible. Subsequently, to capture the inherent nonlinearity of the original data, the algorithm is improved using the kernel trick. In experiments, four widely-used hyperspectral datasets, namely, Indian Pines, University of Pavia, Salinas, and Botswana are classified.

142,2079,"Traditional sampling theories consider the problem of reconstructing an unknown signal x from a series of samples. A prevalent assumption which often guarantees recovery from the given measurements is that x lies in a known subspace. Recently, there has been growing interest in nonlinear but structured signal models, in which x lies in a union of subspaces. In this paper, we develop a general framework for robust and efficient recovery of such signals from a given set of samples. More specifically, we treat the case in which x lies in a sum of k subspaces, chosen from a larger set of m possibilities. The samples are modeled as inner products with an arbitrary set of sampling functions. To derive an efficient and robust recovery algorithm, we show that our problem can be formulated as that of recovering a block-sparse vector whose nonzero elements appear in fixed blocks. We then propose a mixed lscr 2 /lscr 1 program for block sparse recovery. Our main result is an equivalence condition under which the proposed convex algorithm is guaranteed to recover the original signal. This result relies on the notion of block restricted isometry property (RIP), which is a generalization of the standard RIP used extensively in the context of compressed sensing. Based on RIP, we also prove stability of our approach in the presence of noise and modeling errors. A special case of our framework is that of recovering multiple measurement vectors (MMV) that share a joint sparsity pattern. Adapting our results to this context leads to new MMV recovery methods as well as equivalence conditions under which the entire set can be determined efficiently.",Robust Recovery of Signals From a Structured Union of Subspaces,-1.0

The goal of the model was not to obtain a better solution but rather to closely match a number of operational statistics. In addition to the need to capture a wide range of operational issues, the model had to match the performance of a highly skilled group of dispatchers while also returning the marginal value of drivers domiciled at different locations. These requirements dictated that it was not enough to optimize at each point in time (something that could be easily handled by a simulation model) but also over time. The project required bringing together years of research in approximate dynamic programming, merging math programming with machine learning, to solve dynamic programs with extremely high-dimensional state variables.

This paper presents the applicability of least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) for estimating the blast-induced flyrock. For comparison aim, support vector regression (SVR) was also employed. The case study was carried out in the Gole-E-Gohar iron mine of Iran in which the values of burden to spacing ratio, hole length to burden ratio, subdrilling, stemming, charge per delay, rock density and powder factor were measured for 90 blasting operations. The mentioned seven parameters were used as the independent or input parameters in modeling, while, the values of flyrock distance were assigned as the models output. To train the models, 72 datasets were adopted and then the remaining 18 datasets were adopted to test the models. The models performance was compared by several statistical criteria such as R square (R²) and mean square error (MSE). According to obtained results, the LS-SVM with the R² of 0.969 and MSE of 16.25 can prove more useful than the SVR with the R² of 0.945 and MSE of 31.58 in estimation of blast-induced flyrock.

We investigated 1418 men and 2040 women aged 40-74 years and measured the HRV indices in the time and frequency domains using a 5-min R-R interval recording. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to estimate the association between HRV and blood pressure levels after adjustment for major confounders. HRV indices were not associated with systolic blood pressure levels in men, whereas in women, one-s.d.

In addition, a 1-s.d. increment of SDNN corresponded with 1.00 and 1.10mmHg reductions in diastolic blood pressure in men and women, respectively (P<0.05). When stratified by the use or nonuse of antihypertensive medication, these inverse associations were more evident in the nonuser group. Furthermore, among men not using antihypertensive medication, reduced HRV was associated with increased systolic blood pressure levels in nondrinkers. The data suggest that HRV reflects diastolic blood pressure better than systolic blood pressure levels for both sexes and that alcohol intake strongly affects systolic blood pressure levels in men, which may have weakened the association with HRV.",Heart rate variability and blood pressure among Japanese men and women: a community-based cross-sectional study,-1.0

According to the Borst-Guyton concept, chronic hypertension can occur only with a shift in the renal pressure-natriuresis relationship resulting in increased salt sensitivity of blood pressure. We assessed salt sensitivity of blood pressure in a group of 27 healthy adults whose birth weight was available. Birth weight was ascertained from birth certificates or announcements. Salt sensitivity of blood pressure was determined as difference in mean arterial pressure (MAP) between a 1-week high-salt (235 mmol NaCl/d) versus low-salt diet (55 mmol NaCl/d).

158,2676,"Users of Social Network Sites (SNS) use the networks to share content and information about themselves. In particular for -nonymous- SNS, such as Facebook, profiles are connected to real names and appearances: this increases the connection between online and offline identities and the relevance of audiences to the information users share. This can lead users to feel as though they are under someone's constant observation, which can have consequences on how they present themselves on the platform. In this paper, we explore how the perception of an imaginary audience, i.e. the -others- adolescents perceive to be as concerned with themselves as they are, can inform the impression management strategies of adult Facebook users. Based on a Dutch empirical sample, and through a hierarchical regression, we explore the relationship of imaginary audience to impression management (both content-based, such as self-censorship, and audience-based, such as audience restriction). We also investigate the roles of privacy concerns, self-monitoring, age and gender on the self-presentation of users. Our results find positive effects for both imaginary audience and privacy concerns on both content and network-based impression management, while self-monitoring appears to have no effect. The age of respondents also appears to influence content-based impression management strategies, but not network-based strategies. Our paper represents a first attempt at applying the concept of imaginary audience to an adult sample of Facebook users.

Memory type (unique vs. repeated) was a within-participant variable. In Experiment 1, college-age participants generated as many early memories as possible in 4 minutes; in Experiment 2, another sample provided complete reports of five early memories in each condition. In both experiments, participants rated the vividness, biographical importance and personal meaning of each memory and labelled the accompanying emotion. Unique memories were more vivid than repeated memories as well as more likely to include negative emotion, regardless of the method of reporting. Most importantly, college students rated their memories for unique and repeated events as equivalently infused with personal meaning. Analysis of the content of the memories reported in Experiment 2 established that unique and repeated memories did not differ in word count or percentages of perceptual terms or words indicating positive affect, although unique memories contained a greater percentage of negative affect. Additional analyses of content provided evidence for differences in the functions served by unique and repeated memories.

161,2740,"A motor performance which involves multijoint coordination and belongs to the natural repertoire of motor behavior has been studied. Displacements have been related to EMG in the lower limb when taking off and landing from a jump down (45 cm) onto two surfaces of differing compliance in two populations of teenage girls: skilled and unskilled. To evaluate the performance, an index was defined taking into account: 1) the time required for reaching stability (1 body weight) after landing, and 2) the amount of sway during the stabilization time. Despite the apparent intra and inter subject similarities in performing the jump-down, slight differences were observed in both the kinematics and electromyogram patterns. During takeoff, two strategies were identified that were not related to either skill or landing surface compliance. The most common strategy, -Push Off-, is characterized by almost full joint extension when departing from the jump platform and includes a swing period during flight. The other strategy, -Roll Off-, is characterized by joint flexion at departure and continual extension during midflight. While the ankle dorsiflexor, tibialis anterior, is active in preparation for the takeoff phase in both strategies, it is followed by activation of the ankle plantarflexors, lateral gastrocnemious and soleus and the hip/knee musculature, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, and vastus lateralis, only in the push off strategy. The roll off strategy is characterized by a lack of other muscle activation prior to takeoff. At landing, regardless of the strategy used in takeoff, onset of muscles followed the same sequence for both landing surfaces; ankle musculature activity began first followed by activity in the knee and hip musculature. The onset of the musculature occurred closer to landing when landing on the more compliant surface. Skilled subjects were characterized by adjustments in amount of ankle extension present at landing and concomitant flexion post-landing with respect to landing surface. When landing on the rigid surface, the ankle was more plantarflexed and onset of the dorsiflexor occurred after that of the plantarflexors; on foam, dorsiflexor activity was coincident with the plantarflexors. Ankle joint range of motion post-landing was subsequently larger when landing on the rigid surface. In contrast, unskilled individuals used a default strategy for landing on both surfaces where the ankle position and movement was between that seen for the two conditions in the skilled individual. It is suggested the landing and takeoff phases are programmed independently in both skilled and unskilled subjects. Further, it is hypothesized that the skilled individuals may be more adept at making subtle adjustments to landing surfaces by continual update during execution of the movement, while in unskilled subjects this capability is less evident. The effect of long term learning as well as the adaptive capabilities of the nervous system during the execution of the movement in skilled and unskilled subjects is discussed.",Motor strategies in landing from a jump: the role of skill in task execution,-0.75

Cortical reconstruction techniques were used to generate measures of whole-brain cerebral white-matter volume, cortical thickness, and surface area. Results indicated that cerebral white-matter volume in overweight and obese individuals was associated with a greater degree of atrophy, with maximal effects in middle-age corresponding to an estimated increase of brain age of 10 years. There were no similar body mass index-related changes in cortical parameters. This study suggests that at a population level, obesity may increase the risk of neurodegeneration.",Obesity associated with increased brain age from midlife,-1.0

The interviewees were 12 men from a men's counseling program who were nonviolent for 10 months or more. The men explained their abuse as a reaction to their failed macho complex. They viewed the counseling program as a reinforcement for their self-determination to change. And they described the process of change in terms of personal growth, in which they accepted responsibility, became empathetic, and redefined their manhood. The implications of the reformed batterer's perceptions for program development are discussed in the conclusion.","The gender warrior: Reformed batterers on abuse, treatment, and change",0.25
164,2851,"Previous work with healthy adults supports the idea that perception of the orientation of a tool's handle may automatically activate cognitive components for grasping and use. An important source of evidence for this automatic activation view comes from studies showing interference when automatically activated action representations are inconsistent with the behaviors demanded by a task (e.g., Tucker and Ellis, 1998). Here, we evaluated whether such effects occur in a grip selection task in which responses were chosen based on a learned rule (Rule task) versus anticipatory planning (Plan task). Participants were asked to pantomime grasping horizontally presented objects with handles. In the Rule task, a color cue indicated on which side of the tool's handle the thumb had to be placed. In the Plan task, participants had to choose the most comfortable way to grasp and rotate the object into a specific end-position. Across three experiments we found evidence of interference on grip selection exclusively during the Rule task, and only when it was preceded by a prime task that involved tool use. These findings suggest that prior activation of cognitive components through use of tools can be effective over time and interferes with grip selection based on use of a pre-learned rule. Absence of interference effects during the plan task, even when preceded by the Use task, suggest that engagement of similar mechanisms during active planning overwrites this automatic activation of previously effective components. Possible cognitive and neural mechanisms are discussed.",Are tool properties always processed automatically? The role of tool use context and task complexity,-1.0

We compared 100 instant messaging conversations to 100 exchanges with the popular chatbot Cleverbot along seven dimensions: words per message, words per conversation, messages per conversation, word uniqueness, and use of profanity, shorthand, and emoticons. A MANOVA indicated that people communicated with the chatbot for longer durations (but with shorter messages) than they did with another human. Additionally, human-chatbot communication lacked much of the richness of vocabulary found in conversations among people, and exhibited greater profanity.

Newly coined metaphors regularly infiltrate our collective vocabulary and gradually become familiar, but it is unclear how this shift from novel to conventionalized meaning happens in the brain. We investigated the neural career of metaphors in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study using extensively normed new metaphors and simulated the ordinary, gradual experience of metaphor conventionalization by manipulating participants' exposure to these metaphors. Results showed that the conventionalization of novel metaphors specifically tunes activity within bilateral inferior prefrontal cortex, left posterior middle temporal gyrus, and right postero-lateral occipital cortex. These results support theoretical accounts attributing a role for the right hemisphere in processing novel, low salience figurative meanings, but also show that conventionalization of metaphoric meaning is a bilaterally-mediated process. Metaphor conventionalization entails a decreased neural load within semantic networks rather than a hemispheric or regional shift across brain areas.",From novel to familiar: Tuning the brain for metaphors,-1.0

Experiments testing this prediction have been compromised by methodological limitations that preclude their ability to determine its validity. The present study employed a novel methodology designed to overcome these limitations to examine whether individuals with heightened levels of spider-fear exhibit this predicted perceptual bias. Two groups of participants who differed in spider-fear completed a perceptual task that presented stimulus pairs comprising spider and butterfly images under two movement conditions. In one condition images displayed approaching movement, while in the other condition images displayed receding movement. Participants were required to indicate which stimulus they perceived to move fastest. As predicted, it was found that participants with heightened spider-fear demonstrated a significantly greater tendency than low spider-fearful participants to perceive the spider stimuli as moving fastest, only when stimuli displayed approaching movement.

We investigated the relative contribution of the former, sensory-driven, component. Participants viewed sequences of images from five different classes-fractals, overhead satellite imagery, grayscale and colored natural scenes, and magazine covers-and graded each numerically according to its perceived conspicuity. We found significant consistency in this rating within and between observers for all image categories. In a subsequent recognition memory test, performance was significantly above chance for all categories, with the weakest memory for satellite imagery, and reaching near ceiling for magazine covers. When repeating the experiment after one year, ratings remained consistent within each observer and category, despite the absence of explicit scene memory. Our findings suggest that the rating of image conspicuity is driven by image-immanent, sensory factors common to all observers.",Observers are consistent when rating image conspicuity,-1.0

The present study examines potential predictors (e.g., parent and child eating, parent and child weight, and the home environment) of the use of controlling feeding practices among adolescents, an age group that has not received much attention. Parents (N=54, M age=43.63 years, SD=6.42; 94.4% female) of adolescents ages 12-17 (N=54, M age=13.94 years, SD=1.75; 43.6% female) completed measures assessing their child feeding practices, eating patterns and the home environment. Adolescents completed measures of their eating patterns. Regression analyses were used to determine the most salient predictors of controlling child feeding practices, specifically restriction of food intake and pressure to eat. After controlling for adolescent age, parental dietary restraint was significantly associated with restriction and accounted for 15.2% of the variance in the use of restriction, F (1, 51)=10.4, p<.01. Adolescent emotional eating and income-to-needs ratio were significantly associated with use of pressure above and beyond adolescent age and accounted for 29.1% of the variance in the use of pressure, F (2, 48)=10.2, p<.001. This study suggests that future research should include factors from different levels of influence, such as child, parent and home environment.

In experiment 1, normal college students were assigned to 0-, 6- or 24-h of food deprivation prior to presentations of standard emotional and food-related pictures. Food deprivation had no impact on responses elicited by standard emotional pictures. However, subjective and psychophysiological reactions to food pictures were affected significantly by deprivation. Importantly, food-deprived subjects viewing food pictures showed an enhanced startle reflex and increased heart rate. Experiment 2 replicated the food deprivation effects from experiment 1, and examined participants reporting either a habitual pattern of restrained (anorexia-like) or binge (bulimia-like) eating. Food-deprived and binge eater groups showed startle potentiation to food cues, and rated these stimuli as more pleasant, relative to restrained eaters and control subjects. The results are interpreted from the perspective that startle modulation reflects activation of defensive or appetitive motivation.

173,3012,"Learning to make rewarding choices in response to stimuli depends on a slow but steady process, reinforcement learning, and a fast and flexible, but capacity-limited process, working memory. Using both systems in parallel, with their contributions weighted based on performance, should allow us to leverage the best of each system: rapid early learning, supplemented by long-term robust acquisition. However, this assumes that using one process does not interfere with the other. We use computational modeling to investigate the interactions between the two processes in a behavioral experiment and show that working memory interferes with reinforcement learning. Previous research showed that neural representations of reward prediction errors, a key marker of reinforcement learning, were blunted when working memory was used for learning. We thus predicted that arbitrating in favor of working memory to learn faster in simple problems would weaken the reinforcement learning process. We tested this by measuring performance in a delayed testing phase where the use of working memory was impossible, and thus participant choices depended on reinforcement learning. Counterintuitively, but confirming our predictions, we observed that associations learned most easily were retained worse than associations learned slower: Using working memory to learn quickly came at the cost of long-term retention. Computational modeling confirmed that this could only be accounted for by working memory interference in reinforcement learning computations. These results further our understanding of how multiple systems contribute in parallel to human learning and may have important applications for education and computational psychiatry.",The Tortoise and the Hare: Interactions between Reinforcement Learning and Working Memory,0.0
174,3019,"Research on adult age differences in language production has traditionally focused on either the production of single words or the properties of language samples. Older adults are more prone to word retrieval failures than are younger adults (e.g., Burke, MacKay, Worthley, & Wade, 1991). Older adults also tend to produce fewer ideas per utterance and fewer left-branching syntactic structures (e.g., Kemper, Greiner, Marquis, Prenovost, & Mitzner, 2001). The use of eye movement monitoring in the study of language production allows researchers to examine word production processes in the context of multiword utterances, bridging the gap between behavior in word production studies and spontaneous speech samples. This paper outlines one view of how speakers plan and produce utterances, summarizes the literature on age-related changes in production, presents an overview of the published research on speakers- gaze during picture description, and recaps a study using eye movement monitoring to explore age-related changes in language production.",Observing the what and when of language production for different age groups by monitoring speakers' eye movements,-0.75
175,3028,"Mentally simulating a movement is known to share temporal and kinematic characteristics with the execution of the same movement, and this is thought to be reflected in the sharing of neural resources between the two activities. A powerful method of implicitly facilitating such mental simulation (or motor imagery) in individuals is to present them with a picture of a hand and ask them to identify its laterality (i.e. left or right). The mental rotation undertaken in order to complete this hand laterality recognition task (HLRT) provides an effective form of motor imagery, and the task has become an influential tool in clinical and experimental studies. However, performance on the task is modified by numerous factors, and there is a suggestion that the method of response demanded by different versions of the task may have a modulating effect. Here, we compared performance on the HLRT when responding verbally or manually in a group of unimpaired right-handed participants. For manual responses, we also compared performance when participants responded unimanually, using the index and middle fingers of their dominant or non-dominant hand. Performance was poorer for the manual compared to the verbal condition both in terms of accuracy and response time. Furthermore, for manual responses, the requirement to make a response with a specific limb selectively disrupted the ability to recognise an image of the corresponding limb. The disruption is considered to reflect difficulty in concurrently planning two actions with the same limb (manual response and mental rotation). Implications for the interpretation of existing and future studies are discussed.",When the left hand does not know what the left hand is doing: response mode affects mental rotation of hands,0.0

The results confirm that feedback related negativity (FRN) amplitude is modulated by the interaction of outcome valence and expectancy by showing larger FRN difference waves for unexpected than expected outcomes. More interestingly, the difference wave between ERPs elicited by positive and negative expectations showed a negative deflection, with a frontal midline source density around 280 ms after onset of the predictive cue. Negative expectations were associated with larger FRN amplitudes than positive expectations. This suggests that FRN is elicited by probabilistic cues to pending outcomes.",This ought to be good: brain activity accompanying positive and negative expectations and outcomes.,0.5
177,3073,"Milner and Goodale (1995) have proposed that visuomotor and perceptual processes are mediated by discrete visual systems that reflect the functional independence of action and perception. The visuomotor system is proposed to be insensitive to pictorial illusions of object size, whereas the perceptual system is reliably ""tricked"" by such figures. Brenner and Smeets (1996) and Jackson and Shaw (2000) demonstrated that grasp preshaping, but not grasping force, is immune to the Ponzo visual illusion, suggesting that not all visuomotor processes operate independently of the perceptual system. The present study investigated the effect of illusory object size on prehension kinematics and grasping dynamics (i.e., grip force and load force) as well as perceptual judgements of object size. Unlike previous investigations, object mass was held constant independent of changes in size. The Ponzo figure reliably affected perceptual estimates of object size, but this effect was restricted to one form of the illusion. Some aspects of the prehension movement were sensitive to veridical but not illusory object size (peak grip aperture, peak grip force, peak vertical wrist acceleration), whereas other movement parameters demonstrated illusory size effects (movement time, peak wrist velocity). Still other movement parameters were not sensitive to veridical or illusory object size (peak load force). Together the data suggest that certain prehension components are immune to pictorial illusions of object size, whereas others are not. Complex interactions between the perceptual and visuomotor systems appear to underlie the anticipatory scaling of grasping forces in prehension.",The effect of illusory size on force production when grasping objects,-1.0

179,3125,"The face is a special visual stimulus. Both bottom-up processes for low-level facial features and top-down modulation by face expectations contribute to the advantages of face perception. However, it is hard to dissociate the top-down factors from the bottom-up processes, since facial stimuli mandatorily lead to face awareness. In the present study, using the face pareidolia phenomenon, we demonstrated that face awareness, namely seeing an object as a face, enhances object detection performance. In face pareidolia, some people see a visual stimulus, for example, three dots arranged in V shape, as a face, while others do not. This phenomenon allows us to investigate the effect of face awareness leaving the stimulus per se unchanged. Participants were asked to detect a face target or a triangle target. While target per se was identical between the two tasks, the detection sensitivity was higher when the participants recognized the target as a face. This was the case irrespective of the stimulus eccentricity or the vertical orientation of the stimulus. These results demonstrate that seeing an object as a face facilitates object detection via top-down modulation. The advantages of face perception are, therefore, at least partly, due to face awareness.",Seeing Objects as Faces Enhances Object Detection,-0.75

181,3171,"One of the characteristic features of the human motor system is redundancy i.e., the ability to achieve a given task outcome using multiple coordination patterns. However, once participants settle on using a specific coordination pattern, the process of learning to use a new alternative coordination pattern to perform the same task is still poorly understood. Here, using two experiments, we examined this process of how participants shift from one coordination pattern to another using different reinforcement schedules. Participants performed a virtual reaching task, where they moved a cursor to different targets positioned on the screen. Our goal was to make participants use a coordination pattern with greater trunk motion, and to this end, we provided reinforcement by making the cursor disappear if the trunk motion during the reach did not cross a specified threshold value. In Experiment 1, we compared two reinforcement schedules in two groups of participants-an abrupt group, where the threshold was introduced immediately at the beginning of practice; and a gradual group, where the threshold was introduced gradually with practice. Results showed that both abrupt and gradual groups were effective in shifting their coordination patterns to involve greater trunk motion, but the abrupt group showed greater retention when the reinforcement was removed. In Experiment 2, we examined the basis of this advantage in the abrupt group using two additional control groups. Results showed that the advantage of the abrupt group was because of a greater number of practice trials with the desired coordination pattern. Overall, these results show that reinforcement can be successfully used to shift coordination patterns, which has potential in the rehabilitation of movement disorders.",Learning alternative movement coordination patterns using reinforcement feedback,-1.0
182,3191,"During the last decades, research on binary decision making elucidated some of the basic neural mechanisms underlying the decision-making process. Recently, the focus of experimental as well as modeling studies began to shift from simple binary choices to decision making with multiple alternatives. In this article, we address the question how different numbers of choice alternatives might be handled and encoded in the brain. We present a minimal, biophysically realistic spiking neuron model for decision making with multiple alternatives. Our model accounts for the relevant aspects of recent experimental data of a random-dot motion-discrimination task on both the cellular and behavioral level. Notably, all network parameters and inputs in our network are independent of the number of possible alternatives used in the tested experimental paradigms (2 and 4 alternatives and 2 alternatives with an angular separation of 90-). This avoids the use of extra top-down regulation mechanisms to adapt the network to the number of choices. Furthermore, we show that increasing the number of neurons encoding each choice alternative is positively related to the network's capacity of choice-number-independent decision making. Consequently, our results suggest a physiological advantage of a pooled, multineuron representation of choice alternatives.",The encoding of alternatives in multiple-choice decision-making,-1.0

Specifically, we aimed at studying the influence of egocentric references upon geocentric judgements. Seated subjects, orientated at various body orientations, were asked to perceptually estimate the possibility of passing under a projected horizontal line while keeping their gaze on a fixation target and imagining a horizontal body displacement. The results showed a global overestimation of the possibility of passing under the line, and confirmed the influence of body orientation reported by Bringoux et al. (Exp Brain Res 185(4):673-680, 2008). More strikingly, a linear influence of gaze elevation was found on perceptual estimates. Precisely, downward eye elevation yielded increased overestimations, and conversely upward gaze elevation yielded decreased overestimations. Furthermore, body and gaze orientation effects were independent and combined additively to yield a global egocentric influence with a weight of 45 and 54%, respectively. Overall, our data suggest that multiple egocentric references can jointly affect the estimated possibility of passing under high obstacles. These results are discussed in terms of -interpenetrability- between geocentric and egocentric reference frames and clearly demonstrate that gaze elevation is involved, as body orientation, in geocentric spatial localization.",Influence of gaze elevation on estimating the possibility of passing under high obstacles during body tilt,-0.5

186,3217,"We addressed the fundamental questions of which variables underlie the control of arm movement and how they are stored in motor memory, reproduced and modified in the process of adaptation to changing load conditions. Such variables are defined differently in two major theories of motor control (internal models and threshold control). To resolve the controversy, these theories were tested (experiment 1) based on their ability to explain why active movement away from a stable posture is not opposed by stabilizing mechanisms (the posture-movement problem). The internal model theory suggests that the system counteracts the opposing forces by increasing the muscle activity in proportion to the distance from the initial posture (position-dependent EMG control). In contrast, threshold control fully excludes these opposing forces by shifting muscle activation thresholds and thus resetting the stabilizing mechanisms to a new posture. Subjects were sitting, holding the vertical handle of a double-joint manipulandum with their right hand and were facing a computer screen on which the handle and target to be reached were displayed. In response to an auditory signal, subjects quickly moved the handle from an initial position to one of two (frontal and sagittal) targets. No load was applied during the movement but in separate trials, a brief perturbation was applied to the handle by torque motors controlling the manipulandum. Perturbations were applied prior to or 3 s after movement offset, in the latter case in one of eight directions. The EMG activity of the majority of the seven recorded muscles was at zero level before movement onset and returned to zero level after movement offset. Those muscles that remained active before or after the movement could be made silent whereas previously silent muscles could be activated after a small passive displacement (several millimeters) elicited by perturbations in appropriate directions. Results showed that the activation thresholds of motoneurons of arm muscles were reset from the initial to a final position and that EMG activity was not position-dependent. These results were inconsistent with the internal model theory but confirmed the threshold control theory. Then the ability of threshold control theory to explain rapid movement adaptation to a position-dependent load was investigated (experiment 2 and 3). Subjects produced fast movement to the frontal target with and without a position-dependent load applied to the handle. Trials were organized in blocks alternating between the load and no-load condition (20 blocks in total, with randomly chosen number of five to ten trials in each). Subjects were instructed -do not correct- in experiment 2 and -correct- movement errors during the trial in experiment 3. Five threshold arm configurations underlying the movement production and adaptation were identified. When instructed -do not correct-, movement precision was fully restored on average after two trials. No significant improvement was observed as the experiment progressed despite the fact that the same load condition was repeated after one block of trials. Thus, in each block, the adaptation was made anew, implying that subjects relied on short-term memory and could not recall the threshold arm configurations they specified to accurately reach the same target in the same load condition in previous blocks. When instructed to -correct- within each trial, precision was restored faster, on average after one trial. Major aspects of the production and adaptation of arm movement (including the kinematics, movement errors, instruction-dependent behavior, and absence of position-related EMG activity) are explained in terms of threshold control.",Threshold control of arm posture and movement adaptation to load,-1.0
187,3233,"Theoretical models of psychotherapy not only try to predict outcome but also intend to explain patterns of change. Studies showed that psychotherapeutic change processes are characterized by nonlinearity, complexity, and discontinuous transitions. By this, theoretical models of psychotherapy should be able to reproduce these dynamic features. Using time series derived from daily measures through internet-based real-time monitoring as empirical reference, we earlier presented a model of psychotherapy which includes five state variables and four trait variables. In mathematical terms, the traits modulate the shape of the functions which define the nonlinear interactions between the variables (states) of the model. The functions are integrated into five coupled nonlinear difference equations. In the present paper, we model how traits (dispositions or competencies of a person) can continuously be altered by new experiences and states (cognition, emotion, behavior). Adding equations that link states to traits, this model not only describes how therapeutic interventions modulate short-term change and fluctuations of psychological states, but also how these can influence traits. Speaking in terms of Synergetics (theory of self-organization in complex systems), the states correspond to the order parameters and the traits to the control parameters of the system. In terms of psychology, trait dynamics is driven by the states-i.e., by the concrete experiences of a client-and creates a process of personality development at a slower time scale than that of the state dynamics (separation of time scales between control and order parameter dynamics).",Personality development in psychotherapy: a synergetic model of state-trait dynamics,-1.0

To uncover the neural signatures of choice justification, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor neural activity when subjects rated their preference for chosen and rejected musical CDs before and after they made their choices. We observed that the trial-by-trial attitude change (i.e., increase of preference for chosen items and decrease of preference for rejected items) was predicted by post-choice activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), right temporal-parietal junction, anterior insula, and bilateral cerebellum. Furthermore, individual difference in choice justification (i.e., increased preference for chosen items minus decreased preference for rejected items) was predicted by post-choice neural activity in the dorsal MPFC, left lateral prefrontal cortex, and right precentral cortex positively. In addition, interdependent self-construal was correlated with decreased activity in the ventral MPFC in the post-choice than pre-choice sessions.

At least part of these differences might be due to the fact that fish are usually trained with only one or two dozen trials while extensive training, sometimes with thousands of trials, is normally performed in studies of mammals and birds. To test this hypothesis, female guppies were trained on four consecutive numerical discriminations of increasing difficulty (from 2 vs. 3 to 5 vs. 6 items), with up to 120 trials with each discrimination. Five out of eight subjects discriminated all contrasts up to 4 versus 5 objects at levels significantly better than chance, a much higher limit than the 2 versus 3 limit previously reported in studies that provided fish with only short training sequences.

Fully 81% of the instances of thiy in the corpus were followed by a suspension of speech, whereas only 7% of a matched sample of thuhs were followed by such suspensions. The problems people dealt with after thiy were at many levels of production, including articulation, word retrieval, and choice of message, but most were in the following nominal.","Pronouncing ""the"" as ""thee"" to signal problems in speaking",-0.75
193,3311,"We define a solution to the problem of coalition formation that applies to purely hedonic games. Coalition structures satisfying our requirements are called durable, and we interpret them as much more likely to last than those coalition structures not satisfying the requirements, which we call transient. Durability results from a combination of foresight and extreme risk aversion on the part of agents, when considering to join others to disrupt an existing structure in search of higher gains. Agents- calculations are also constrained to satisfy a strong consistency requirement, which is reflected in the recursive structure of our definition. We prove that durable coalition structures always exist, and we provide examples of hedonic games where our solutions apply nicely.",On coalition formation: durable coalition structures,-1.0
194,3336,"We compared the effect of skin temperature on the critical threshold temperature eliciting heat pain with the effect of skin temperature on the response latency to the first heat pain sensation in healthy human subjects. Also, we determined the effect of the duration of a heat stimulus ramp on pain threshold. Furthermore, we determined the effect of skin temperature on mechanically induced pain. We found that the latency to the first pain sensation induced by a radiant heat stimulus was significantly decreased with an increase in the skin temperature (25-35 -C). However, independent of the rate of the stimulus rise (3-10 -C/s) and independent of the stimulus location (hairy vs glabrous skin), the threshold temperature for eliciting the heat pain sensation, determined with a contact thermostimulator, was not changed by a change in the skin temperature in the same subjects. With a fast rate of stimulus rise, a higher pain threshold was obtained than with a slow rise of stimulus temperature. However, this difference was found only with subject-controlled ascending stimuli (method of limits) but not with experimenter-controlled, predetermined stimulus ramps (method of levels). The heat pain threshold was higher in the glabrous skin of the hand than in the hairy skin of the forearm. With increasing stimulus duration (2.5-10s), the threshold temperature eliciting the heat pain sensation was significantly decreased. The mechanically induced pain threshold was not influenced by the skin temperature. The results indicate that the critical temperature for eliciting heat pain is independent of the skin temperature in humans. However, a change in skin temperature is an important source of an artefactual change in heat pain sensitivity when the radiant heat method (latency or energy) is used as an index of pain sensitivity. With a method dependent on reaction time (the method of limits), the heat pain threshold was artefactually increased, with fast rates of stimulus rise due to the long delay of slowly conducting heat pain signals in reaching the brain. With an increase in the duration of the heat stimulus, the critical temperature for eliciting pain sensation was significantly decreased, which may be explained by central neuronal mechanisms (temporal summation).",Influence of skin temperature on heat pain threshold in humans,-1.0
195,3337,"Our studies of naturally occurring human dialogue have led to the recognition of a class of regularities which characterize important aspects of communication. People appear to interact according to established patterns which span several turns in a dialogue and which recur frequently. These patterns appear to be organized around the goals which the dialogue serves for each participant. Many things which are said later in a dialogue can only be interpreted as pursuit of these goals, established by earlier dialogue. These patterns have been represented by a set of knowledge structures called Dialogue-Games, capturing shared, conventional knowledge that people have about communication and how it can be used to achieve goals. A Dialogue-Game has Parameters, which represent those elements that vary across instances of a particular pattern-the particular dialogue participants and the content topic. The states of the world which must be in effect for a particular Dialogue-Game to be employed successfully are represented by Specifications of these Parameters. Finally, the expected sequence of intermediate states that occur during instances of a particular conventional pattern are represented by the Components of the corresponding Dialogue-Game. Representations for several Dialogue-Games are presented here, based on our analyses of different kinds of naturally occurring dialogue. A process model is discussed, showing Dialogue-Game identification, pursuit, and termination as part of the comprehension of dialogue utterances. This Dialogue-Game model captures some of the important functional aspects of language, especially indirect uses to achieve implicit communication.",Dialogue-Games: Metacommunication Structures for Natural Language Interaction,-0.75
196,3354,"Activities that engage young children with the sensory properties of foods are popular with nursery schools, despite the lack of evidence for their efficacy in increasing children's consumption of healthy foods. This study provides the first empirical exploration of the effectiveness of a non-taste sensory activity program in a nursery school setting. Ninety-two children aged between 12 and 36 months were allocated either to an intervention group, who took part in looking, listening, feeling and smelling activities with unusual fruits and vegetables every day for 4 weeks, or to a non-intervention control group. In a subsequent mealtime taste test, children touched and tasted more of the vegetables to which they had been familiarized in their playtime activities than of a matched set of non-exposed foods. The results demonstrate that hands-on activities with unfamiliar fruits and vegetables can enhance children's willingness to taste these foods, and confirm the potential for such activities to support healthy eating initiatives.",Exposure to foods' non-taste sensory properties.
