0,"Much previous work has been done in attempting to identify humor in text. In this paper we extend that capability by proposing a new task: assessing whether or not a joke is humorous. We present a novel way of approaching this problem by building a model that learns to identify humorous jokes based on ratings gleaned from Reddit pages, consisting of almost 16,000 labeled instances. Using these ratings to determine the level of humor, we then employ a Transformer architecture for its advantages in learning from sentence context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and show results that are comparable to human performance. We further demonstrate our model's increased capabilities on humor identification problems, such as the previously created datasets for short jokes and puns. These experiments show that this method outperforms all previous work done on these tasks, with an F-measure of 93.1% for the Puns dataset and 98.6% on the Short Jokes dataset.",Humor Detection: A Transformer Gets the Last Laugh,2
1,Gastrulation is one of the major events during the embryogenesis of an animal. In addition to the formation of the germ layers it is often the time when the future axial properties and digestive openings become apparent and it is not surprising that this event plays an important role in hypotheses regarding metazoan evolution. A major difference between these theories concerns the structure of the alimentary canal and the relationship of its openings to the blastopore of the last common bilaterian ancestor. Here we review competing theories of bilaterian evolution and evaluate their plausibility in the light of recent insights into metazoan phylogeny and development.,"The mouth, the anus, and the blastopore - open questions about questionable openings",2
2,"microRNAs (miRNAs) have wide-ranging effects on large-scale gene regulation. As such, they play a vital role in dictating normal development, and their aberrant expression has been implicated in cancer. There has been a large body of research on the role of miRNAs in medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. The identification of the 4 molecular subgroups with distinct biological, genetic, and transcriptional features has revolutionized the field of medulloblastoma research over the past 5 years. Despite this, the growing body of research on miRNAs in medulloblastoma has largely focused on the clinical entity of a single disease rather than the molecular subgroups. This review begins by highlighting the role of miRNAs in development and progresses to explore their myriad of implications in cancer. Medulloblastoma is characterized by increased proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and maintenance of stemness programs-features that are inadvertently regulated by altered expression patterns in miRNAs. This review aims to contextualize the large body of work on miRNAs within the framework of medulloblastoma subgroups. The goal of this review is to stimulate new areas of research, including potential therapeutics, within a rapidly growing field.

4,"The Christmas season can have a major impact on human health. Especially increased contact with in-laws during the holiday season is an important environmental factor known to affect both physical and mental health (Mirza et al., 2004). However, the mechanism through which in-laws influence host health is not yet understood. Emerging evidence has identified the intestinal microbiota as an important mediator for both physical and mental health. Here, we performed a prospective observational study to examine the impact of contact with in-laws on the gut microbiome during the Christmas season. We conducted 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing of fecal samples collected at two separate time points (December 23rd and December 27th 2016) from a group of 28 healthy volunteers celebrating Christmas. To discriminate between participants who visited their own family versus their in-laws, we built a multivariate statistical model that identified microbial biomarker species. We observed two distinct microbial-biomarker signatures discriminating the participants that visited their in-laws versus their own family over the Christmas season. We identified seven bacterial species whose relative-change profile differed significantly among these two groups. In participants visiting in-laws, there was a significant decrease in all Ruminococcus species, known to be associated with psychological stress and depression. A larger randomized controlled study is needed to reproduce these findings before we can recognize in-laws as a potential risk factor for the gut microbiota composition and subsequently host health.",The effect of having Christmas dinner with in-laws on gut microbiota composition,2
5,"Computational analysis has become ubiquitous within the heliophysics community. However, community standards for peer review of codes and analysis have lagged behind these developments. This absence has contributed to the reproducibility crisis, where inadequate analysis descriptions and loss of scientific data have made scientific studies difficult or impossible to replicate. The heliophysics community has responded to this challenge by expressing a desire for a more open, collaborative set of analysis tools. This article summarizes the current state of these efforts and presents an overview of many of the existing Python heliophysics tools. It also outlines the challenges facing community members who are working toward the goal of an open, collaborative, Python heliophysics toolkit and presents guidelines that can ease the transition from individualistic data analysis practices to an accountable, communalistic environment.",Snakes on a Spaceship—An Overview of Python in Heliophysics,2
6,"The discovery that nitric oxide (NO) has powerful vasoactive properties identical to those of endothelial-derived relaxing factor spawned a vast body of research investigating the physiological actions of small gas molecules. NO, which arises endogenously through the action of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes, is a highly reactive gas that plays important roles in the regulation of vascular and immune function. Carbon monoxide (CO), a similar yet much more chemically stable gas, occurs in nature as a product of the oxidation or combustion of organic materials. CO also arises in cells and tissues as a byproduct of heme oxygenase (HO) activity, which degrades heme to biliverdin-IXalpha. Like NO, CO acts as a vasorelaxant and may regulate other vascular functions such as platelet aggregation and smooth muscle proliferation. CO has also been implicated as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. HO-1, the inducible form of HO, confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. CO, when applied at low concentration, exerts potent cytoprotective effects mimicking those of HO-1 induction, including down-regulation of inflammation and suppression of apoptosis. Many of the effects of CO depend on the activation of guanylate cyclase, which generates guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP), and the modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. This review highlights new advances in the interaction of CO with cellular signaling processes. ",Carbon monoxide: to boldly go where NO has gone before,2
7,"In recent years, an exponentially growing number of studies have focused on identifying cancer stem cells (CSC) in human malignancies. The rare CSCs could be crucial in controlling and curing cancer: through asymmetric division CSCs supposedly drive tumor growth and evade therapy with the help of traits shared with normal stem cells such as quiescence, self-renewal ability, and multidrug resistance pump activity. Here, we give a brief overview of techniques used to confirm the stem cell-like behavior of putative CSCs and discuss markers and methods for identifying, isolating, and culturing them. We touch on the limitations of each marker and why the combined use of CSC markers, in vitro and in vivo assays may still fail to identify all relevant CSC populations. Finally, the various experimental findings supporting and contradicting the CSC hypothesis are summarized. The large number of tumor types thus far with a subpopulation of uniquely tumorigenic and therapy resistant cells suggests that despite the unanswered questions and inconsistencies, the CSC hypothesis has a legitimate role to play in tumor biology. At the same time, experimental evidence supporting the established alternative theory of clonal evolution can be found as well. Therefore, a model that describes cancer initiation and progression should combine elements of clonal evolution and CSC theory.

8,"Optical-fibre communication systems form the backbone of the Internet. Current systems rely on a technology called wavelength-division multiplexing to transmit digital information at high speeds. On the transmitter side, this technology combines (multiplexes) many optical channels into a single optical fibre. Each channel uses a laser of a different frequency, and hundreds of lasers are typically needed to occupy the bandwidth available in a fibre-optic link. On page 274, Marin-Palomo et al.1 demonstrate that all of these lasers can be replaced by a single light source known as a microresonator frequency comb — a development that could lead to extremely fast data transmission.",One ring to multiplex them all,2
9,"Complex environments may place constraints on animal sensory perception. However, little is known about how ecological constraints impact the formation of animal social groups, which ultimately necessitate that conspecifics detect one another. Here we studied the fission–fusion social groups of highly social terrestrial hermit crabs (Coenobita compressus), which frequently split and recombine, requiring individuals to actively sense the location of conspecifics. We manipulated the environment by relocating abundant natural fallen leaves on the beach, testing how and why this debris may constrain social group formation. Our experiments revealed that fallen leaves impose a fundamental limit on social grouping, with experimentally simulated groups attracting significantly fewer conspecifics (75% less) if they were surrounded by leaves. This constraint on social grouping was not the result of leaves acting as a physical barrier to movement. Furthermore, leaves only hindered visual perception of conspecifics and did not hinder other modalities besides vision. By experimentally moving leaves above the horizon, such that they no longer blocked animals’ field of view, we found that the impact of these visual constraints on grouping could be effectively abolished. Broadly, these experiments elucidate how complex environments impose sensory constraints on social animals’ ability to navigate toward groups.",Leaf me alone: visual constraints on the ecology of social group formation,2
10,"At the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species this month (1) [HN1], Namibia is asking for an annual quota for the sale of ivory that is “accumulated from natural and management-related mortalities [HN2].” The discussion is likely to be steeped in controversy, not least because of the complexity of the economic and ecological arguments involved. Managing elephant [HN3] populations and evaluating the sustainability of the ivory trade require not only detailed economic analyses, but also recognition of the ecological complexities that influence decisions about elephant management [HN4].",Space--The Final Frontier for Economists and Elephants,2
11,"Advances in functional brain imaging have allowed the development of new investigative techniques with clinical application—ranging from presurgical mapping of eloquent cortex to identifying cortical regions involved in religious experiences. Similarly a variety of methods are available to referring physicians, ranging from metabolic measures such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography to measurements based on electrical activity such as electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography. However, there are no universal benchmarks by which to judge between these methods. In this study we attempt to develop a standard for functional localisation, based on the known functional organisation of somatosensory cortex.1 Studies have shown spatially distinct sites of brain activity in response to stimulation of various body parts.2 Generally these studies have focused on areas with large cortical representations, such as the index finger and face.3,4 We tested the limits of magnetoencephalography source localisation by stimulation of body parts, namely the clunis and the cubitus, that map to proximal and relatively poorly represented regions of somatosensory cortex.",Can you tell your clunis from your cubitus?

12,"Background: External dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is considered to be the gold standard treatment of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction. A better understanding of the endoscopic anatomy of the lacrimal sac has increased the success rate of endonasal DCR. Laser DCR has become popular in recent years and has a success rate comparable with those of other endonasal techniques. The aim of this study was to compare the surgical results of endonasal DCR (EDCR) and endonasal laser DCR (ELDCR). Methods: Fifty-four patients treated with ELDCR and 42 patients treated with EDCR for nasolacrimal duct obstruction from 2009 to 2012 with at least 1.5 years of follow-up were retrospectively enrolled in this comparative study. Lack of patient complaints and irrigation testing were used as subjective and objective assessment tools, respectively. Results: Both groups were similar in terms of age and sex. ELDCR had a success rate of 85.2%, and EDCR had a success rate of 92.9%. The difference between the 2 procedures was not statistically significant. ELDCR had a significantly shorter operative time than did EDCR (16.9 vs 24.4 minutes, respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Endonasal procedures have the advantage of no scar formation and do not disturb the pumping mechanism of the lacrimal sac. Their success rates are comparable with those of external DCR. Surgery is quicker, and with use of a laser, even less time is spent in the operating room. In selected cases, ELDCR can be a good alternative method with a high success rate.",The return of the jedi: comparison of the outcomes of endolaser dacryocystorhinostomy and endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy ,2
13,"The developmental plasticity of the root system represents a key adaptive trait enabling plants to cope with abiotic stresses such as drought and is therefore important in the current context of global changes. Root branching through lateral root formation is an important component of the adaptability of the root system to its environment. Our understanding of the mechanisms controlling lateral root development has progressed tremendously in recent years through research in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). These studies have revealed that the phytohormone auxin acts as a common integrator to many endogenous and environmental signals regulating lateral root formation. Here, we review what has been learnt about the myriad roles of auxin during lateral root formation in Arabidopsis. ",Lateral root development in Arabidopsis: fifty shades of auxin ,2
14,"When it comes to equity investing, size matters — and in a much bigger way than previously thought — but only when controlling for junk. The authors examine seven empirical challenges that have been hurled at the size effect and systematically dismantle each one by controlling for a firm’s quality. The authors contend that previous evidence on the variability of the size effect is largely due to the volatile performance of small, low quality “junky” firms. Controlling for junk, a much stronger and more stable size premium emerges that is robust across time. These results are robust across a variety of quality measures as well. We further find that interactions between size and other firm characteristics, such as value and momentum, can also be fully or partially explained by quality versus junk. Hence, the quality of a firm helps clean up the relation between size and the cross-section of expected returns. These results revive the size anomaly, putting it on more equal footing with other anomalies such as value and momentum in terms of its efficacy and robustness, and dismiss several previous explanations for the size effect. Size should therefore be restored as one of the central cross-sectional empirical regularities, presenting an even further challenge for asset-pricing theory.","Size Matters, If You Control Your Junk",2
15,"Developing and improving computational approaches to covering news can increase journalistic output and improve the way stories are covered. In this work we approach the problem of covering crime stories in Los Angeles. We present a machine-in-the-loop system that covers individual crimes by (1) learning the prototypical coverage archetypes from classical news articles on crime to learn their structure and (2) using output from the Los Angeles Police department to generate ""lede paragraphs"", first structural unit of crime-articles. We introduce a probabilistic graphical model for learning article structure and a rule-based system for generating ledes. We hope our work can lead to systems that use these components together to form the skeletons of news articles covering crime.

16,"Wildlife tourism is a growing industry, with significant conservation and socio-economic benefits. Concerns have however been raised about the possible impacts of this industry on the long-term behaviour, health and fitness of the animal species tourists come to see (the target species), particularly when those species are regularly fed to improve the tourism experience. Information on the contribution of food rewards to the diet of the target species at feeding sites is critical to assess the dependency on handouts and to identify possible health/fitness problems that might be associated, if handouts become the main part of animals' diets. Here, we use stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) to evaluate the importance of handouts for a marine predator, the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), at a feeding site (Fiji) where shark feeds occur 5 days/week and sharks (up to 75 individuals/dive) are fed ~200 kg of tuna heads/day. There was no evidence of incorporation of food provided, even for individuals that regularly consume food rewards. Results, when combined with those from previous studies on bull shark movements and feeding rates at our study site, show that current levels of provisioning likely have no long-term impacts on bull shark diet or behaviour. This study also demonstrates the applicability of stable isotope analysis to assess and monitor the contribution of food rewards to wildlife, and highlights the benefits of using multi-sources of information to gain a holistic understanding of the effects of provisioning predators.",You are what you eat: Examining the effects of provisioning tourism on shark diets,2

19,"Charlie Wilson (D-TX) described his decision to retire from the U.S. House of Representatives as the best of the three options open to him: “To get defeated, to get carried out feet first, or to … start another life” (Gerhart and Groer 1995). Although much research has been undertaken on electoral defeat (Collie 1981; Ferejohn 1977; Jacobson 1992; Mann 1978) and voluntary retirement (Gilmour and Rothstein 1996; Groseclose and Krehbiel 1994; Hall and Van Houweling 1995; Hibbing 1982; Kieweit and Zeng 1993; Schansberg 1994), research on death is still in its infancy. Indeed, rather than staring death in the face, political scientists have buried the issue. In one recent study, for example, mortality is treated as a form of retirement: Members of the House leave for a number of reasons, most prominent among them being electoral defeat and retirement. Other avenues of departure include death and expulsion. … Simplifying somewhat, we categorize all departures as either the result of electoral defeat or the result of ‘retirement’ (Gilmour and Rothstein 1996, 56). Of course, some deaths—suicides—are voluntary. However, although many members of Congress die in office, suicide is extremely rare. Accordingly, we caution against treating death as a form of retirement. Otherwise, members of Congress must be presumed to engage in such implausible calculations as the following: “Let's see now. How shall I spend the next few years? I suppose I'll run for re-election. But maybe I should retire so I can spend more time playing golf. Or, since I'm thinking of retiring, why don't I just shuffle off this mortal coil, cross over Jordan's bank to the Stygian shore, pay my debt to nature, and join the choir invisible?”",Leaving Office Feet First: Death in Congress,2
20,"The three p53 family members, p53, p63 and p73, are structurally similar and share many biochemical activities. Yet, along with their common fundamental role in protecting genomic fidelity, each has acquired distinct functions related to diverse cell autonomous and non-autonomous processes. Similar to the p53 family, the Hippo signaling pathway impacts a multitude of cellular processes, spanning from cell cycle and metabolism to development and tumor suppression. The core Hippo module consists of the tumor-suppressive MST-LATS kinases and oncogenic transcriptional co-effectors YAP and TAZ. A wealth of accumulated data suggests a complex and delicate regulatory network connecting the p53 and Hippo pathways, in a highly context-specific manner. This generates multiple layers of interaction, ranging from interdependent and collaborative signaling to apparent antagonistic activity. Furthermore, genetic and epigenetic alterations can disrupt this homeostatic network, paving the way to genomic instability and cancer. This strengthens the need to better understand the nuances that control the molecular function of each component and the cross-talk between the different components. Here, we review interactions between the p53 and Hippo pathways within a subset of physiological contexts, focusing on normal stem cells and development, as well as regulation of apoptosis, senescence and metabolism in transformed cells.",p53 shades of Hippo,2

The strength of BAT converges faster and better than other SOTA models, as its 4-layer structure achieves the best F scores at 50 epochs. In other words, it performs better than other models which require deeper layers at 100 epochs. To generate rich and clean tags, awoo creates new objective functions to maintain similar F1 scores with cross-entropy while enhancing F2 scores simultaneously. To assure the even better performance of F scores awoo revamps the learning rate strategy proposed by Transformer \cite{Transformer} to increase F1 and F2 scores at the same time.",Born for Auto-Tagging: Faster and better with new objective functions,2
23,"Quite surprisingly, exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding of neural language generators frequently leads to low-quality results. Rather, most state-of-the-art results on language generation tasks are attained using beam search despite its overwhelmingly high search error rate. This implies that the MAP objective alone does not express the properties we desire in text, which merits the question: if beam search is the answer, what was the question? We frame beam search as the exact solution to a different decoding objective in order to gain insights into why high probability under a model alone may not indicate adequacy. We find that beam search enforces uniform information density in text, a property motivated by cognitive science. We suggest a set of decoding objectives that explicitly enforce this property and find that exact decoding with these objectives alleviates the problems encountered when decoding poorly calibrated language generation models. Additionally, we analyze the text produced using various decoding strategies and see that, in our neural machine translation experiments, the extent to which this property is adhered to strongly correlates with BLEU.","If beam search is the answer, what was the question?",2
